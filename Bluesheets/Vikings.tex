History of when the storm has hit your nation, and what that changed for your nation each time.
Separate document for the whole game that just has the timeline

Timeline of the Storms:
Timeline of Storms
Storms - hit every 3 years
Is everyone there, everyone who is part of the school?  Or are there other students there?
More than the players, but they’re off on “Holiday” - getting sent home to spend time with family in case they get blown up by a storm that your classmates are going to be picking
NPCs that aren’t present that players may have close personal ties with
College - 3 year education
Non-royalty - must be smart enough, talented enough, have enough magic
Royalty - automatically get to go
Some people pay to go, some people get in based on connections
Some are voting as freshmen, some as older
Storm Hit These Locations starting with present year:
Present year - happening, don’t know where

\section{Religion:}

\section{Religious or moral principles:}

Separatists - doesn’t trade with anyone, self sustaining
Little bit of everything - water, fertile land, mountains and valleys for mining, etc
Would always have less than those who trade, but would be less impacted when other nations are hit, hit harder when they are hit
Separatists nations tend to be more warfaring
Other nations would have more alliances, may send storms toward separatist country several years in a row → causing separatist country to suffer and start sacrificing goats to get a leg up
Rise of the Chupacabra religion could be from here!!! No alliances
Ocean-faring, somewhat agrarian -- This is the separatist country
Industrial equivalence to Victorian-era innovation or sailpunk
Live by the water / ocean
Vikings?  Hunting leviathans, taking trophies, hanging them on their ships, etc
Religion tends to be warlike, chaos, childbirth, women, sea serpents, death, sex
God of Balance/duality
Balancing good and evil acts
God of chaos - God of Change
Leadership
Counsels / republic
Disparate groups that come together for counsels
Chiefs get together to vote / etc
Chiefs are elected democratically (21st century morality, arguably the “villains” but voted for it)
What type of democracy?  Representative or true?
Borrow from Silent Conversation - consensus building from ground up.  Within each community, people decide whether isolationist or not.  People get together in small group (ie: by house / boat / etc).  Discuss until agree.  One representative from each discussion go to discussion at village and talk until agree.  Propagate upwards / hierarchical process
Could be using this process to elect who is going to the school, rather than “son / daughter / child of the leader”
What caused them to shift to isolationism?
Fear mongering?
Have a leader / charismatic public speaker convince people that they’re the bad guys and they’re out to get you
Could play on balance
For years and years and years, we have been cooperating / trading / etc.  Now need to reset balance and withdraw for a while
Get hit 2x in a row → spur for them to become isolationist.  Chain of events that leads to them withdrawing.  3rd storm also goes against them
2nd storm - balance is off, need to be isolationist
3rd storm - they’re going to be isolationism, we’ll send the storm only against them
Some of the Vikings believe it was a mistake
Some of them believe in order to restore balance, need to restore the school
Why did the 2nd storm go against them?
Plot - uncovering history
Bad blood between people at school?
Why did this happen?
Could be something that some characters are interested in


Why are the Vikings isolationist?  Why would the storms ever be sent toward the allies?
Originally every three year / equal sharing
Recent change in Viking culture, no longer trading, pulled out of alliances
Alliance started hitting only separatists
Separatists changed to Chupacabra religion - want to take out school, stop targeting nations.  People at lower levels / low socio-economic in other countries have joined them because they’re tired of being hit also because they get hit the hardest when storms hit
Some Vikings may disagree with this
Why not just wipe out Vikings?
Could be that military of Vikings is too strong for them to be taken out?  Using storms instead?
Leviathans - unspoken truth that they would attack people on shore if Vikings do not hunt them, Vikings hunting them is good for all nations - another reason to not wipe out Vikings
All countries should have coast - school is landlocked, countries are not → one continent
Maybe Vikings also have islands as well around most of it


Vikings
Overall Culture:
Worship God of balance, hit by last two storms, go around and fight sea monsters and that was important to culture, Democracy
Heroically defend balance of world by fighting epic sea creatures and utilize democratic element.  
Currently isolationist but weren’t in the past.  Voted on and implemented to reestablish balance

Vikings - monsters stronger or use magic to fight them, without magic might not be able to - entire set of cultures might lose ability to be seafaring
Vikings - separate from Chubacabra religion but more likely to be part of Chubacabra religion because seen as option in part of restoring the balance.  Not endorsed by Vikings, just growing more easily there because of terrible conditions there
Some Vikings - don’t want to destroy magic


Vikings
Before seafaring / able to take on serpents
Decreased ability to go fishing, not able to go fishing
Cultural consequences and losses
Potentially preparing for this outcome?  Didn’t think this would work in the first place

Vikings do not believe there is a technological solution but may not believe it should be ended immediately so not all Chubacabras
Storm is the Balance - maintains balance, should be shared out equally

Why shouldn’t they just continue to hammer the Vikings / wipe them off the earth?
Sea serpents - make them very important
Nothing to control them, they are ability to walk on land?
Impassable mountain between Agrarian and Mageocracy, have to use boats to go between or they’re on two islands
Archipelago of islands?  School just on another island
Vikings patrol islands and hunt sea serpents
What happens when mageocracy makes airships?
Sea serpents that can fly for short periods of time - enough to take down an airship
Tell story to various characters - in history, so-and-so invented an airship that would attempt to get from one place to another but eaten by the flying sea serpent!
Bulk materials - airships can’t carry much.  Perhaps just one path but it was lost?
Communication - magical communication devices
Vikings 
Before isolationism - were the sole fleet of ships
Afterwards - the other nations had to build their own ships, but weren’t very good at it (or lent some of the fleet?)
Were they being paid a lot for these services?  Why would they go isolationist?  Maybe a movement but not complete thing.  Vote was isolationist but dissenters have become pirates and are conducting illicit trade between two nations
How has that impacted ability of two nations to trade or are they building their own boats?  Short term impacts, probably nations building their own boats.  Dissenters, defect and pass on ship building knowledge, ships
Dissenters may still keep old Gods / old religion since still “maintaining the balance”
Chubacabraists - perhaps the more “liberal” of the religion (out of rebellion against poverty).  Perhaps more likely to be young, except for the students of the school, as they are hand picked
Thoroughly indoctrinated - less likely to convert mid game than those who just haven’t been exposed


Vikings
Magic to deal with monsters, possibly to build / keep ships (why nations can’t just build ships of their own)
Using more subtle magic, may not be aware of it
Faction may start as “we don’t need magic” but one or two people start researching, find out might not be so OK
Chubacabra - why don’t all of them jump on
Has to be more than traditionalist
Family that is in charge because have lots of magic is invested in magic not going away
Perhaps one of them has theory that ships go faster because magic - will go do research to prove it
A Viking kid who wants to go to school might run to go to school to prove / disprove thesis
Vikings initially sympathetic to Chubacabras but then backpedal
Probably looking to elect kids who will try to break up deal between Agrarian and Technocracy
How often do elections happen?  Annually as turn 18 (17-year-olds get to campaign for this)


Vikings have fortifications on opposite side to protect the opposite side of the map


Oracles in other religions?  How to communicate with the Gods
Casting runes - Vikings / Technocracy?
Perhaps each one has large creatures as oracles, Chubacabra religion is attempting to get an oracle to communicate with
Chubacabra or horrifying creature
Giant 3-headed goat - probably not
Vikings
Sea serpent?  Kept reincarnating but eventually stopped because got mad
Maybe sea serpents are so bad because kept killing the messengers
Now rely on runes until they are able to get their oracle back


Immigration: Viking - 6 months on our ships, if can’t hack it then we dump you wherever we are and you go your own way

Wave Riders
Chosen family is very important
Transitory - very uncommon to marry one person and stay with them for 50 years and stay with them for X years
More common - stay on a ship, one family and group of kids, move to different ship and have different family and group of kids
If folks on that ship love the child, maybe leave on the ship or maybe take with you
Kids maybe follow moms around getting experience on a bunch of boats getting experience before ready to make cultural decision or maybe stay with their “cousins’
Also leaves door open for deadbeat mothers
