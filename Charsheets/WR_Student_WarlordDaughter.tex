%Renee AKA WR Student Warlord Daughter
You are \cWarlordDaughter{} (\cWarlordDaughter{\They}/\cWarlordDaughter{\Them}). You are the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of \cLoud{\full}, and that makes life\ldots complicated. You love your country and your family, but you are ready to chart your own course out of their shadow.

Your life growing up was simple and full of love. You grew up on an unusually stable ship with very little turnover in the crew. You know that \cLoud{} is your biological \cLoud{\parent} and has been with \cQuiet{\full} since before you were born, a rarity in \pShip{}. Your parents encouraged your interest in the Priesthood and supported your desire to attend the 1st fleet academy to study.

Then the storm hit the \pShip{} out of turn. It was a complete disaster. Your ship, Black Crow of the 10th fleet, nearly sank, and you lost more than half of your crew\ldots your family. Not long after, \cLoud{} began to talk of revenge. Of balancing the scales. Of war. War was a scary prospect, but you understood the need for balance - after all, it is the \pShippies{} way of life. What was weird was that \cLoud{} was advocating for it. \cLoud{\They} \cLoud{\were} always the calm, quiet, patient sort. \cLoud{\They} never resorted to violence if there was another way. And then overnight, bloody vengeance was all they could talk about. Something was clearly wrong, but you never figured out what.

In the wake of this change, your dreams of attending 1st fleet academy evaporated. You traveled with the remains of Black Crow, helping \cLoud{} whip up the support \cLoud{\they} needed to convince the Council of Stormwatchers. As time went on, you saw less and less of your parents. Your quiet, happy life was gone. Even what remained of your family was gone. Once the war started in earnest, \cQuiet{} convinced \cLoud{} that you would be safer at school. The fact that nearly everyone in \pShip{} knew your name as the daughter of \cLoud{} made you a shoo-in to attend \pSchool{}. It was supposed to be an honor, but you couldn’t help feeling like they had sent you away.

Now you are here, in your second year at the \pSc{}. Even though you aren’t graduating, there are a lot of things weighing on your shoulders. Everyone expects you to be, speak for, or reject \cLoud{}. They watch your every move like ospreys. You are consulted regularly by both well meaning and manipulative advisors seaking to know \cLoud{}’s mind. You will of course comport yourself with all the dignity required of the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of \cLoud{\full}, but you don't actually \textbf{want} to spend all day in stuffy meetings.

Part one of charting your own course is winning voting authority. Since the teachers, advisors, and the Goddesses themselves are all involved in awarding voting authority, there is tremendous prestige in being the student granted the most votes to cast. Prestige that would elevate anyone on their own merits. Prestige that will last long after you graduate and return to \pShip{}! Prestige aside, you wouldn’t mind the peace of mind that having more votes would provide you, with regards to the ability to protect your home by sending the storm elsewhere.

Part two of being recognized as your own person is being chosen as the student speaker for the graduation ceremony. It is not unusual for an underclassmen to be chosen for this and it would make a great first platform to distinguish your views from your \cLoud{\parent}. You are pro justice, fairness, and reparations. War is one way to accomplish it, but that’s complicated, messy, and rife with consequences. That’s something that \cLoud{} used to understand - it’s something that \cLoud{\they} taught you! You want your \cLoud{\parent} back the way \cLoud{\they} \cLoud{\were}. What ever happened to change them so?

In search of the answer, you’ve searched the library countless times. But now, it’s urgent. The looks some of these advisors give you makes your skin crawl and you’re sure some of them mean you harm. You just have to figure out what happened to \cLoud{} \textbf{this weekend}, and find a way to reverse it. This is so important, and you’ve been struggling with it for so long. You are just grateful you don’t have to do it all alone.

You have a close confidant in \cHeir{}. \cHeir{\They} have been such a good friend to you and you tell each other almost everything. Since \cHeir{} is the scion of a powerful \pTech{} family, it took you a while to decide to trust them, but you are glad you did. \cHeir{\They} are an immense source of support for you, and you for \cHeir{\them}. You know that \cHeir{} doesn’t actually want the empire \cHeir{\they} \cHeir{\are} supposed to inherit. \cHeir{} knows that \cLoud{} is acting out of character by leading the war effort. The two of you have searched everywhere, and asked everyone you could as discreetly as you could.

So maybe the answer isn’t in the library after all? Maybe \cEbb{} or \cFlow{} could help? You’ve prayed to them before, but this weekend you will have Clergy of both paths at the \pSc{}. You could pick a path, and become a full fledged \cWarlordDaughter{\cleric} yourself. Maybe then the Goddesses would hear your prayer and act. Becoming a \cWarlordDaughter{\cleric} is an involved and life-changing process, but ever since you came up with the idea, you’ve come to realize that you’d want to do it anyway. Working the will of the Goddesses through your own hands feels right, in a way that nothing else has since \cLoud{} started rabble-rousing. And doing this would be one more way to step out of \cLoud{\their} shadow.

As a student of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}, the idea of ending the storms seems impossible to you. Balance is the driving force for everything. Trying to avoid consequences now just makes things worse later. What trade-offs are they willing to make? Given that \cHeadScientist{} and \cAssistantScientist{} are from \pTech{}, the nation that orchestrated the betrayal of \pShip{}, and necessitated the war to restore balance - you shudder to think what they might be willing to trade. It’s not fair that they should be so clever and yet arrayed against the \pShip{}. Perhaps you will uncover something of interest if you can check out those meetings and investigate their claims?

Speaking of careers as a \cWarlordDaughter{\cleric} - there is another initiate at the \pSchool{} who may also be looking to pick a path this weekend. \cInitiate{} is from 2nd fleet, and is the sort that drips privilege. \cInitiate{\They} \cInitiate{\does}n't mean any harm by it, but sometimes \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are} completely clueless. \cInitiate{} has family in \pFarm{} - family going back for generations. What you wouldn’t give to have a family like that. One you could rely on. One that would go to such immense lengths to get you back. One that didn’t switch personalities over night\ldots Is it weird to wish someone wanted you around so badly that they would send a curse across national borders to get you back?

Okay, so maybe the curse was a little much - or a lot much. You should help \cInitiate{} figure out a way to remove it. You still think they should give \cInitiate{\their} family a chance though. It doesn’t seem like \cInitiate{} understands what it means to be loved like \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are}.

Your number one priority this weekend is figuring out what happened to your \cLoud{\parent}, \cLoud{}, and fixing it if you can. If \cLoud{\they} were to stop advocating for war, maybe you could get back your simple quiet family life that you miss so much. You refuse to risk the safety of your nation in the meantime however, and intend to make that very clear in word and deed. Lastly, you do hope to make your own way as more than just your \cLoud{\parent}’s \cWarlordDaughter{\child}.
