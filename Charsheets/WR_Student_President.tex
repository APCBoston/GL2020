%%Ross Cheung AKA WR Student President

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

You are \cPresident{} (\cPresident{\they}/\cPresident{\them}), and a student at \pSchool{}. You are 22 years old, the Student Body President, and it is your (self appointed) job to keep your fellow students safe when the adults won't. You are from \pShip{}, and primarily follow the teachings of \cEbb{\full}. Ebb's focus on selective pruning of things dead or no longer needed, providing answers and closure, and paving the way for new things, drives you.

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

You were born in the 2nd fleet, and grew up with \cInitiate{}, your best friend. The two of you did everything together, except go to academy. You went to 2nd fleet academy, which focused on politics, negotiation, and economic management; \cInitiate{\they} went to 1st fleet academy to study religion. You hoped to follow in your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}'s footsteps and become a politician. The war breaking out in your 5th year of schooling only served to emphasize the need for diplomatic solutions that never-the-less centered justice and reparations for past wrongs. At \pCollege{}, your earlier schooling served you well, and you are now the student body present. Reunited with your best friend, \cInitiate{} the two of you are more or less unstoppable.

You are committed to finding out what happened at the \pSc{} six years ago - just before the war started. You know there was treachery, there must have been. How could the students from \pShip{} have voted to send the storm there out of turn? They would have known that it disrupted the balance. And the Gods see to the punishment of murderers, it is up to the people to see justice is brought upon those who enabled it. It is up to you and a few others you have convinced of the urgency of finding answers: \cLibAssistant{}, and \cHeir{}. You haven't been able to uncover the truth before now because something was missing, you need \iMirror{}, which is arriving this weekend in the possession of \cDiplomat{} - now you just have to hope \cDiplomat{\they} will part with it.

Uncovering the past isn't the only thing on your mind. You've also got to look to the future. For the good of your country, the student body in general, and for your friends among them, there are a couple of things happening this weekend you can't just leave the grown ups in charge of. Firstly is the ritual to control the storm. After the voting, a ritual is enacted to channel the magic from the students into actually directing the storm. The ritual requires the use of one relic per nation. Per protocol, for the \pShip{}, the \iNet{} must be used. The \iChalice{} was used 3 years ago, and it is necessary for balance that they alternate. Further, the \iNet{} was involved in the ritual 6 years ago. It is fitting that it be used in the ritual the year you are going to set everything to rights.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.

\textbf{Primary Plots:}

(3) The Net of Two Phases (Ebb's relic)  - wants this relic to be used in the ritual because Balance; used the Hallowed Chalice (Flow's relic) last time.

(4) Preparing the Ritual - Care about getting it right for the sake of the Leau. If the ritual is tampered with, it might go even more poorly for us. Also class president responsibility.

(5) What happened to the students? - Wants to find out what happened. A student of Ebb, destruction should be to some purpose - something this big can’t have been the work of 1; and the Gods probably only punished the people who directly executed the attack. Need to find who else masterminded it and bring them to justice.

(12) Covering for a Murderer - Related to the missing diplomat. You were so looking forward to seeing your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}. Why aren't they here? what happened to \cHeadDiplomat{\them}

(31) Ew, Not them! - crushing on \cHeir{} and \cChupStudent{}. with \cInitiate{}'s help, you want to find out if 1) they are willing to poly. 2) can find some work around for the whole war thing.

\textbf{Secondary Plots:}

(13) Librarian’s Amnesia - As student body president, interacts with the faculty more than most. \cLibrarian{} is acting weird - suspect amnesia (that's BAD! who did they kill?!!)

(18) David/Rebecca - \cIntiate{} is your best friend. Must make helping! weird curse thingy, family in CoS... how can I support you?

(36) The Ley Lines - responsibility to help keep the school running.
