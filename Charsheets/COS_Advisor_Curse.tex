\name{\cCurse{}}

You are \cCurse{\full} (\cCurse{\they}/\cCurse{\them}), greatest cursemaker in the \pFarm{} at a venerable 72 years old. Not'everyone sees you that way -- some insist on considering you a doddering old fool. And it is true -- sometimes your stuff explodes when it wasn't supposed to. But just as often, you accomplish something previously thought impossible. You are the only commoner among the \pFarm{} delegation as far as you know, and certainly the only one among the advisors. As such, when you are obligated to engage in politics, you consider it your unofficial duty to speak for the commoners.

The problem with being a curse expert is that curses are generally dismissed as the purview of the common folk in the \pFarm{}, and most kids with any notable magical talent among the common folk are swept up by the nobility. You were never so lucky. So instead, you learned from the hedge magicians around you, and became quite adept at both curse making and breaking. 

You quite enjoy the creation and casting of curses, and have made quite a few in your storied career. Some are quite mild - a fit of giggles whenever someone attempts to approach their crush, a touch of courage, or a dose of sexual vigor. Some are subtle -- good luck under a waning gibbous moon, or red paint that makes customers want to spend more money. And some are sledgehammers - infertility, locusts, and even memory loss that rivals that of the Gods. In your younger years, you made curses for whoever could pay, all over \pEarth{}, and never thought too hard about what they would be used for. It was just so nice not to be treated like dirt by the \pFarm{} nobility that you went, admittedly, a bit wild. You still do pro-bono work for commoners, whenever you can spare the time.

But now there's a war on, and your country's war machine is fueled primarily with curses. Your services are in higher demand than ever. You even got to meet the \cQueen{\Majesty} a few years back. But even if you weren't already getting wiser as you got older, war has the kind of moral implication that would make anyone think twice. You have a duty to your country, you suppose, but what mostly keeps you supplying curses for the trebuchets is thinking about the generations of pirate raids on the coast -- not to mention the extortion of the coastal \pFarm{} by even the ``good'' \pShippies{} in exchange for protection from sea serpents. If the \pTech{} really can end the Storms, maybe breaking the ``Time of Peace'' treaty will all have been worth it.

But according to your sources, that's a big if. As with many folks on \pEarth{}, you have a variety of penpals. Among them is \cHedonist{\full}, a \cHedonist{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{}. The two of you have spent long hours discussing what little is known of the \pTech{} plan to end the Storms and debating whether or not it's actually possible. The two of you have decided to work together this weekend to get to the truth once and for all. If you can interrogate the scientists under either a Truth-Telling Curse, or if you can manage it, under the power of the Lariat of Truth, you could establish the veracity of their claims. Doing it in front of other witnesses would be ideal. During or after their presentation on Saturday afternoon seems like the best time for this, since then everyone will have heard for themselves what the scientists are claiming when not compelled to the truth. If it turns out that the \pTech{} can't really end the Storms, then well\ldots you've got some serious soul searching to do.

Another penpal of yours is a aeacher at the \pSc{} named \cChupSecond{\full}. Even since before the war, \cChupSecond{} has occasionally abused the supposed neutrality of teachers at the \pSc{} to trade you some interesting artifact \cChupSecond{\they} \cChupSecond{\have} or another. The most recent was also one of the most interesting in recent months -- an ornately carved wooden box with quite a powerful protection curse on it. You dismantled the curse and opened the box, only to have \cChupSecond{} snatch it away before you caught more than a glint of gold inside. What does \cChupSecond{} know about what was in that box? And what did \cChupSecond{\they} do with it afterwards?

Your favorite penpal though is \cFlowPriest{\full}. \cFlowPriest{} is another Teacher at the \pSchool{} and quite a delight to discuss magical theory with. \cFlowPriest{} has a most creative and ambitious spark, something \cFlowPriest{\they} credits \cFlowPriest{\their} patron \cFlow{\God}, \cFlowFull{\full} with. The two of you have been collaborating for several years now on what you expect will be your greatest accomplishment, something that will blow everyone away (in a good way). The two of you are working on a way to reach the Realm of the Gods, by creating a way to \emph{grow} a magical portal overnight. Once complete, people will be able to step through and talk to the Gods face to face. It's simply \emph{genius}! This morning, when the advisors arrived, was your first real chance to sit down with \cFlowPriest{} and talk in person about the project in several years. You know that any talk of traveling to the Divine Realms is considered blasphemy in the \pFarm{}, and to a lesser extent in the other nations, so you'd best keep this project just between you and \cFlowPriest{} for now.

Of course, beyond getting the opportunity to meet some of your friends, you have other duties to consider as an advisor. You are supposed to be at the negotiating table to discuss treaties and cease-fires and so forth -- which is one of the most boring uses of time you can imagine. You'd much rather be hanging out with the gifted engineer \cBunker{\full}, shooting the shit about the practicalities of magic and discussing ways to improve and reinforce the blessings already woven into the Bunkers. Maybe \cBunker{\they} will even let you help maintain them if you ask nicely? That's all to say, unless \cEvil{\full} forces you for some reason, you'll be leaving the politics to those who actually enjoy it. You seriously doubt \cEvil{\they} will bother, as \cEvil{} is among the highest ranking nobility and as such has no desire to share power with anyone, least of all a commoner.

Still, as long as you are here, you might as well see whether any of the students still have a taste for curses -- or if they are all hoity toity nobles who won't touch the damn things. You're not exactly looking for a prodigy, but if one happened to fall into your lap, you wouldn't object. You figure your best bets are \cLibAssist{\full} and \cAdopted{\full}, seeing as \cLibAssist{}'s family is very low ranking nobility and probably won't look down on you too much, and \cAdopted{} has made no secret about being unhappy at having been adopted from a commoner family. As an advisor, you have the carrot to offer of your influence toward student voting authority for the ritual to direct the Storm. While you know that \cPrince{\full} is the curse breaking teacher at the \pSc{}, \cPrince{} is, well, a \cPrince{\Heir}, and therefore the most stuck up kind of noble. Even if \cPrince{\they} \cPrince{\were} doing \cPrince{\their} best to teach the students, \cPrince{} can't possibly be that good at it. All of which is to say, you expect a fair share of curses to be brought to you for removal. Everything has a price though. While you're happy to charge an arm and a leg to those who can afford it, you're also willing to show some flexibility for a good cause.

Speaking of good causes and inspiring students, one of the Advisors will be honored this weekend to give the speech at the Ceremony of Excellence where the students showcase what they have learned. When these students graduate, they will go on to be movers and shakers in their countries. The teachers shape their minds day in and day out, but as an Advisor, this is your one big chance. While you have no taste for politics and you know you can't turn the whole social order on its head with a single speech, you would still dearly love to be the first commoner from the \pFarm{} to give the speech, both to prove that it can be done and to tweak the nose of the nobility. \cMusic{\full}, one of the teachers, is in charge of arranging the roster this year, and you intend to convince \cMusic{\them} to make you this year's speaker. Awkwardly, your primary competitor is your good friend \cHedonist{}, but what's a little healthy competition between friends?

As long as you don't get roped into too much politicking, this weekend has the potential to be the greatest weekend of your illustrious career. Not only do you have a few mysteries to solve, but together with \cFlowPriest{}, you are going to open the first known portal to the Realm of the Gods! In the meantime, though, you've got a reputation to uphold as the greatest cursemaker in the entire \pFarm{} -- no, in all of \pEarth{}. It'll be tough, but you're up for the challenge.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Assist with the myriad of curse making and curse breaking you expect to be afoot this weekend. Uphold your reputation as the greatest curse maker in \pEarth{}!
	\item Finish the \iBeansNB{} with \cFlowPriest{}, plant them in time for them to grow, and then visit the Realm of the Gods -- just to say you've done it.
	\item Make sure the Storm does not get sent to the Children of the Sun. Your nation is ill prepared to receive it, and it is always the common people who suffer the most.
	\item Work with \cHedonist{} to verify the science the \pTech{} is touting to end the Storms once and for all. One means of doing so would be to compel the scientists to speak truthfully with either a Truth-Telling Curse or the Lariat of Truth.
	\item Help \cBunker{} manage the normal wear and tear on the bunkers. See if you can do anything to improve the protections already laid down.
	\item Land a role speaking at the Ceremony of Excellence.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item Many of your closest contacts are clerics. You find comfort in religious practices, and the culture and community built up around them.
	\item This is the first time you have ever been to the College of the Gods.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cFlowPriest{}} Your collaborator on the \iBeansNB{} that will take you to the Realm of the Gods.
	\contact{\cChupSecond{}} Your primary contact at the \pSc{} who trades you interesting artifacts. Not particularly friendly, but you've worked together long enough to build a rapport based on \cChupSecond{\them} always being efficient and honest during your dealings.
	\contact{\cHedonist{}} A \cHedonist{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{}. Your friend and collaborator for uncovering the truth behind the \pTech{}'s claim to be able to end the storms. Also your primary competition for the speaking role at the Ceremony of Excellence. 
	\contact{\cEvil{}} The head of the \pFarm{} delegation to the negotiating table. Stuck up like all the rest of the nobility, but at least it means \cEvil{\they} probably won't drag you to the negotiating table.
	\contact{\cPrince{}} The curse breaking teacher. As a noble, you are sure \cPrince{\they} \cPrince{\are}n't very good at \cPrince{\their} job. You expect to need to step in and help, assuming \cPrince{} will let you.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} A brilliant engineer who you hope to work with and talk magical theory with this weekend.
	\contact{\cMusic{}} The teacher in charge of the Ceremony of Excellence, and the person you have to convince that you deserve the speaking role.
\end{contacts}
