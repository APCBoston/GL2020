%Do not set as any gender other than male%

You are \cPirate{\full} (\cPirate{\they}/\cPirate{\them}). You have taught Shop and Crafting at the \pSchool{} for 18 years, and everyone knows you as genial and approachable. While you started life as a pirate aboard the 8th fleet Silent Fog, nearly two decades on land have you questioning whether you actually want to go back. Either way, this weekend will be the culmination of many things you have long prepared for.

You grew up in 8th fleet, bouncing from ship to ship. Eighth and 9th fleet struggle more than anywhere else in the \pShip{}, and youngsters are often sent on to the next ship when there isn’t enough food to go around. It’s not surprising therefore that many ships ultimately turn to piracy, preying on \pShippies{} as well as the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}. The Silent Fog is the best there is, and you were lucky to end up aboard her.

Her captain was so successful in part due to their ability to play the long game. Long enough that they forged paperwork and sent you to work at the \pSchool{} to see what you could learn. And you learned so much, particularly about the relics that are used to control The Storm. The Storm devastated wherever it hits, but pirate ships, with no safe harbor to anchor in, are often battered to pieces among the jagged shoals of \pWod{}. One relic in particular, the \iNet{} was of interest. When steeped in the high energy magic of the building storm, it can be used to directly control the tides and waves. With it, a ship could survive any Storm, no matter how bad, and would be nigh on uncatchable. So you and the Captain hatched a plan to steal it.

As part of your cover, you made a point to get to know the other teachers, and the subset of Advisors who come to the school every three years. \cEthics{}, the Ethics teacher, took a surprising shine to you, and the two of you have been great friends almost since you first set foot on the Island on which the school is built. \cEthics{} is an incredibly intelligent \cEthics{\person}, and while you are very good at pretending, you are not entirely sure you have \cEthics{} fooled.

Still, you were quite surprised when \cEthics{\they} asked you a tremendous favor less than a year after you arrived. \cEthics{} had agreed to help an anonymous parent get an innocent child to safety in \pShip{}. You’ve always had a soft spot for children, and while you knew life on the Silent Fog wouldn’t exactly be easy, you could think of no better place to conceal the child. So you did.

On the advisor side, there is \cBunker{} and \cPrince{}. \cBunker{} designed and installed the Bunkers that help protect the people at the school from the Storm as it builds in power. The two of you love to talk shop and trade tips and tricks on building things - even if \cBunker{\their} focus is on engineering and architecture, and yours is more on repair and crafting intermediate materials. Seeing as you are both \pShip{}, you have the most delightful conversations about how the littlest details can make or break a project. 

\cPrince{} is your romantic interest. You mostly have to keep in touch via letters, so time in person is quite precious. Unfortunately, \cPrince{\their} moderate dislike of pirates has blossomed into a full blown hate ever since \cPrince{\their} royal train was attacked and they were robbed. Talk about awkward.

Maybe you can talk them around? Maybe you can find the right moment to tell them the truth? Or maybe it’s time to hang up your pirate hat? It has been almost two decades since you were aboard the Silent Fog. In your time at the \pSc{}, you’ve come to admire \cFlowPriest{}, and \cFlowPriest{\their} devotion to \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}. It’s too bad there haven’t been male priests in over a century. It may prove impossible to convince the Priestesses to induct you. Still, \cBunker{}, in whom you have confided this hope, believes you will succeed. And it really would be a convenient solution to \cPrince{}’s hate. Your relationship could continue, either remotely, or one of you could move to the other’s country.

Doing so without fulfilling your initial mission would leave the Silent Fog high and dry though. The Captain has sent someone here, this weekend, to help you retrieve the net. They are to find you with the phrase ``the Waters untouched are not abandoned.‘’, and you are to respond with ``Those brave enough chart the course‘’ so they know you are true. Once you find each other, the two of you must prevent the \iNet{} from being used in the ritual, and smuggle it off the island, without getting caught by anyone who is anti-pirate. It would be particularly hard to talk your way out of it if \cPrincipal{} found out. \cPrincipal{\They} take no pains to hide their intolerance.

Maintaining a cover this deep involves more than friends. You occasionally have to be seen making an effort above and beyond. In this case, you’ve settled on being picked to give the Teacher’s speech  at the Graduation Ceremony. It’s a nice, flashy, public thing you can do to maintain the charade. And when you sat down to try to write something up, you found yourself surprisingly impassioned. You drew on the inequalities you grew up with, and now you very much want to point the graduating students at the socioeconomic inequalities in \pEarth{}. The plight of the pirates will never change if those in power cannot understand that they are driven to it by desperation and a lack of opportunity.

The \iNet{} will protect the Silent Fog. Maybe your speech (if you can convince \cMusic{} to pick you) will convince these kids to eventually do something to change the socioeconomic imbalances. But what of everyone else in the mean time? \pShip{} needs a break from being battered by the storm. As a teacher, part of your responsibilities this weekend is to contribute to the selection process for which students get the most voting authority for where to send the Storm. You have been on the look out for which student among the \pShippies{} has the strongest presence and will be able to convince students from other nations to join to vote to send the storm somewhere other than \pShip{}.

So all that’s left is to decide what your future looks like. Will you be going back to the Silent Fog? Will you succeed in becoming a priest of \cEbb{} or \cFlow{}? Will you and \cPrince{} still be an item when the dust settles? So many questions. You’d better get down to answering them.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Find your pirate contact from the Silent Fog, help them get the properly attuned and powered up \iNet{} off the island without getting caught. Don’t let \iNet{} be used in the ritual.
	\item Decide which \pShip{} student is the most likely to be able to build the coalition necessary to ensure the storm is not sent to \pShip{}, then convince your fellow teachers to give that student the most voting authority.
	\item Figure out what to do about \cPrince{}. Is there any way to not have this relationship go down in flames?
	\item Decide if you still want to be a pirate, or if you want to try to become a Priest.
	\item convince \cMusic{} to pick you for the Teacher’s Graduation speech. Then give a speech that will inspire the new generation to address the socioeconomic inequalities in their countries.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You expect the pirate here to help you liberate the \iNet{} to approach you with the exact phrase ``the Waters untouched are not abandoned.’’ The proper, exact, response to indicate you are the person they are looking for is ``Those brave enough chart the course.’’ You will have to be careful though, many people do not like pirates, or even hate them. If the wrong person somehow knew the code phrases, or overheard you, it could blow everything.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cEthics{}} Your first friend at the school. You hit it off almost immediately.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} A friend who supports your desire to be a priest.
	\contact{\cPrincipal{}} The principal of the \pSchool{}. They are vehemently anti-pirate and if \cPirate{\they} found you out, getting fired would probably be the least of your worries.
	\contact{\cPrince{}} Your long distance love interest - there has to be a way you can stay together despite their hatred of pirates.
\end{contacts}

Voting authority - Storms are -bad- for pirates who don’t have a safe harbor to hide in; storm has to go SOMEWHERE ELSE. Looking for which student has the strongest presence and will be able to convince students from other nations to join to vote to send the storm somewhere not the L’eau. - initially supporting Renee; might switch to Jos once revealed as pirate.

What becomes of us after I steal the net? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GkM-AooG2NSfY1WNXo_CNEDfFg0jse9uMgxhhG4gyB4/edit?usp=sharing

Pick a Path... -  About that whole thing… it’s  been almost 2 decades since you were on the Silent Fog. You aren’t sure you actually want to go back. If you’re being honest with yourself, what you really want is to be a priest. But precedence is… lacking.

\textbf{Secondary Plots:}

Pirate Child  - \cEthics{} gave you the child 17 years ago. (\cEthics{} and you struck up a friendship almost as soon as you joined the school). You dropped them off at the cove where contactless drop off/pick ups were made. Wonder what made you think of that today?
