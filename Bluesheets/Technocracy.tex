\name{\bTech{}}

The \pTech{} is a nation of dreamers, inventors, and artists.  Located in the northern portion of \pEarth{}, and separated from the \pFarm{} nation by a mountain range known as the \pSpine{}, the \pTechies{} live in a vibrant and beautiful nation whose natural vistas and vast urban centers inspire creativity in all who see them. The \pTech{} is seen both nationally and internationally as a beacon of technology and the arts, but struggles with the inherent economic class and income differences imposed by capitalism and competition. To counter this, they have also adopted many social programs and regulations to try to ensure that everyone can afford a good life.  

Eight years ago, the \pTechies{} reached the brink of perfecting a technological solution to the problem of the Storms. With the promise of this new technology, the Council saw fit to form a new alliance with the \pFarm{}, with whom they agreed to send the storms exclusively towards the \pShippies{}, so that the other two nations could have the available resources to pursue this invention for the good of all nations in the long term. In the aftermath of this betrayal, the \pShip{} declared war on the allied nations in hopes of claiming safe land and punishing those who had wronged them.

\section*{Government}
The \pTech{} is run by a group of officials called the Council, which is led by the Arbiter. Some Council members are appointed, and some are elected to represent various self governing groups like the Unions.  This Council makes the laws and everyday decisions needed to maintain a thriving culture and economy, but bows to the authority of the Temple where the governance of magic is concerned. The Council appeals to the Temple on behalf of the people to further tech, magic, and the arts. They also orchestrate the provision of universal health care, child care, basic income, education, career placement and matchmaking services.

The current council numbers 12 people who are notable in many different fields. The members of the Council most relevant to game are as follows:
		Arbiter:		\cArbiter{} speaks as leader of the group and only votes in ties.
		Elected:	\cElected{} is the current official elected by the general public. 
		Old Family:	\cFaledonParent{} is the head of the Faledon family, who were the original philanthropic family who designed the structure of the government during the founding of the nation, and who have for generations since spoken for the rights of the poorest. They are an incredibly wealthy family, with many patented inventions, and they provide many scholarships for promising but underprivileged students seeking higher education or apprenticeship. Such students usually go on to work for Faledon Industries.
		%% Economist:	\cEconomist{} is the head of the Economics department of the Free People's National Bank.
		%% Educator:	Every two years the Heads of Schools elect one of their number to represent them.  The current Educator, \cEducator{}, has been reelected eight times so far, and is likely to be so again, as they’ve done a credible job.
		Tech Star: Annually a huge Tech Expo is held, and anyone who has, without the help of a team, invented a new piece of technology may compete for the position of Tech Star, and they speak for the young and brilliant. The current Tech Star, \cTechStar{}, is young enough to also be a student at \pSchool{}. The Tech Star only governs for a year before the next one is chosen.
		%% Union Administrator:	Each Union's Leader reports to the Union Master, who represents the interests of all the Unions to the Council.  An election is held every five years within the Unions for this position.  The current Union Admin is \cUnionAdmin{}.
		%% Patent Holder:	 \cPatentHolder{} is a brilliant career inventor, who was granted a Council seat because she holds a record three times more successfully produced individual patents than her next competitor.
		%% Temple Scion:  \cTempleScion{} known as “\cTechGod{}’s Grace”, is the leader of the Temple and speaks on behalf of the Temple's interests.
		%% Magician in Chief:  \cMagician{} is the Temple Magician in charge of regulation of tech enabling magics.
		%% Lead Scientist:  \cHeadScientist{} is a research scientist employed by the council who studies subjects deemed relevant.  Current primary project is the means to stop the Storm, and it is in this capacity that \cHeadScientist{} will be attending this weekend’s events at \pSchool{} as an Advisor.
		War Consultant: During times of war a Consultant is selected to sit in the Council and speak on matters regarding the war effort.  The current Consultant is \cWar{}.

\section*{The War Effort}
The war with \pShip{} was not the predicted outcome of the Treaty with \pFarm{} made six years ago, as the \pShippies{} have historically been slow to adopt great changes. Unfortunately, a warmonger rose up among the \pShippies{} and stirred them to attack viciously, stirring sea serpents to ravage coastal lands. This Warlord, \cLoud{\full}, is reviled by \pTechies{} and \pFarm{} alike, and every encounter with the \pShippies{} has been brutal. And if that were not bad enough, the \pShip{} has also unleashed their ``Pirates,’’’ who seem bent not on war, but on looting, and have no qualms about killing to take what they want, amnesia or no. As such, the \pTech{} has suffered terrible losses, and national morale is at an all time low for those who live in coastal regions. 

Thankfully, the trebuchets invented three years ago are going a long way towards countering \pShip{} incursions, and the Council and the Temple have been acting as one to counter the \pShip{} war efforts. The new defense is currently holding the \pShip{} mostly at bay -- hopefully long enough to finish the research on ending the Storms, and reach a peaceful resolution to the war.
	
\section*{Economy}
Technological inventions go through a lengthy process to be produced. Tech is prototyped by an inventor, approved by the Temple, enabled by a Magician, licensed by the Council’s Office, and finally manufactured and sold in either the free or subsidized markets. 

Scientists are researchers who study magic as it applies to tech and the world, often in esoteric fields. Such abstract science often lacks immediate economic value, so they usually work for the Temple or Council. Art is also valued highly, as aesthetically pleasing clothing and possessions are marks of status. Acting, writing, painting, harmonious garden design, etc., all are paid highly.  

The recent war with \pShip{} has cost both lives and resources as well as inciting civil unrest -- since as per usual, the poorest have been hit hardest by the war, and have the fewest resources to replace the dried up imports from the \pShippies{}. The elites and the Council are concerned at the state of the economy, which is showing signs of instability.

\section*{Technology}
VidCom devices were recently invented in the annual Tech Star competition but are not yet widespread because the Council fears letting them fall into the hands of the \pShippies{}.  Widespread Tech includes hoverboards that operate over tracks in roads, toasters and other household appliances, wearable tech in clothes, etc.

Education
All students attend public “Lower” schooling until age 15, then “Upper” specialized education in fields such as Art, Performance, and Technology for those whose families can afford to send them. Children of poorer families can petition wealthier families for adoption to get access to higher education. This raises the prestige of both families because both are seen to be prioritizing the education of the child. A few truly exceptional students may also be granted scholarships. Each Technology specialized Upper school holds an annual Tech Faire, where both students and non-students may apply to present their inventions. The best of these inventions will be sent on to compete in the National TechStar Competition.
Geography
Mountain ranges make up the southern half of the nation, with forested areas to the West, vast cities to the East and a perilous coastline to the North.
Government
The Free People's Federation is run by a group of council members led by the Arbiter. Some are appointed, some are elected to represent various self governing groups like the guilds, and one is that year’s TechStar.  This Council makes the laws and everyday decisions needed to maintain a thriving culture and economy, but bows to the authority of the Temple where the governance of magic is concerned.

Economy
Technological inventions are prototyped by an inventor, approved by the Temple, activated by a magician, licensed by the government, and manufactured and sold through a variety of means.  Art is valued highly, and aesthetic and design are marks of status. Actors, authors, painters, garden designers, etc., are all highly paid. Much of the nation’s food is imported from neighboring countries, the L’eau who sail the seas, and the Children of the Sun who work the fertile lands to the South.
Religion
The Free People follow Koro, the God of Knowledge and Inspiration.  Koro's Avatars (physical manifestations of divine power) are the Celestial Beetles, who pick up ink with their feet to leave runes on paper for Priests to interpret.

Koro punishes many crimes among his followers directly. Unregulated magical enchantment of technology is punished by a lifetime inability to use tech or magic, the former of which is crippling in such a technologically advanced society. Murder, kidnapping, major Intellectual Property theft, and scam artistry are all punished with total memory loss.
Magic
All magical tech is regulated by the Temple, and must be activated by a Temple appointed magician. Most household items use some degree of magic. Tech that hasn’t been activated by a magician will not function. (OOC Note: this is a kludge, you cannot rewrite the laws of physics in the world and make a generator that works without magic)
Taboos/Norms
Every member of society is expected to raise themselves up, stand out, and attempt to achieve wealth, fame, and greatness. Large families are the norm, and each kid is seen as an opportunity to raise a genius. It's an unspoken shame not to be able to afford higher education for all your children. 

All forms of sexuality and relationships are considered valid and good, but not having kids is considered unlucky. Usually families who can't have children will adopt. Those who secretly prefer not to have children will sometimes join professions that aren't considered as safe, like the Guard - in this profession and some others, it is considered an honorable sacrifice to not have kids.
Costuming
Clothes are often a status symbol, working class folks likely wear loom woven clothing such as denim, cotton, etc, while middle class wear a mix of manufactured clothing that looks like professional or high end leisure clothes of today, and woven, as they can afford.  The wealthy wear the most fashionable of clothing, which looks like shiny fabrics in flowing or fitted designs.  All the classes will try to show what wealth they can in their clothes, and this is often a major household expense.  All classes and genders are likely to wear some flashy cosmetics and/or accessories, as they can afford.

	Trade:		
National:	
Arts:		Performance, Fashion Design, Art Pieces, etc.
		Tech:		VidCom devices, many modern amenities, toasters, wearable tech clothes, medical tech, etc
		Magic:		Magicking items so that anyone can use them, Enabling Prototypes, Manufacturing, and Work Mages who are in various industries ie. construction where they use skills to ease, enhance, or enable work.
		Service:	All forms of service industry, including sales.
		International:	Art, performance, and fashion are the primary exports, includes many portraits of agrarian queen, novels and luxuries for overlords, small tech like lights and most big Tech is kept back, however in last 20 years there has been a gradual increase in farming tech sold to \pFarm{}, so now they are more reliant on it and this produces significant income for those involved in trade.  Irrigation, food preservation tech, plant diagnosis and treatment, medical diagnostic devices, weather prediction, water conservation tech, cooking tech, etc are all sold.  All trade with \pShip{} stopped when the war began, although there is some black market trade occurring that the officials have not yet been able to thwart.  This has recently become a major problem as the \pShippies{} have been acquiring \pTech{} weapons and technology that is turned against the soldiers of \pTech{}.
		Major Industries:  VidCom and other tech devices, Manufacturing, Marketing, Banking, Higher Education, Theater, Fashion, education, etc.
	






\section*{Religion}
The \pTechies{} follow \cTechGod{}, the \cTechGod{\God} of Knowledge and Inspiration. \cTechGod{}'s Avatars are the Celestial Beetles, small insects who walk through ink in order to leave the \cTechGod{\God}’s runic messages on paper for scholars to interpret.  

The Temple strictly regulates the use of magic and places limitations on what technology can be produced. They do this in the interest of ensuring that the tech benefited the people and encouraged peace, unity, equality, and innovation.

The Circle of Five, the highest officers of the Temple, govern according to a written conscriptus of religious laws. The Temple was founded at the birth of the Nation, by the Grace of \cTechGod{}.

\cTechGod{} punishes the following crimes among \cTechGod{\their} followers:  Murder, kidnapping, major Intellectual Property theft, and scam artistry are all punished with memory loss. Unregulated magical activation of technology, on the other hand, is punished by a lifetime inability to use magic or technology. If the crime is not as severe, it may lead to temporary memory loss or a temporary mark on the forehead that brings social shame.

%% \section{The Storm}
%% The Storm six years ago should have been ours, but as per the treaty with \pFarm, it was directed to hit \pShip.  The students who cast this Vote are heroes, but were murdered at the school after the Vote.  They are honored and remembered by the entire nation as well as their families. Past storms that struck \pTech{} were 15, 24, and 33 years ago, during which time the three nations had a rotation Treaty, prior to which time there were frequent battles, assassinations, and machinations to direct the Storms.
	
\section{Education}
Education is free through general education schools that keep kids until they are 15. After that, there are private and Council run schools that teach trades -- but these come with a hefty tuition depending on the exact specialty. Scholarships exist only for the truly exceptional, so children of poorer families get education primarily by petitioning wealthier families to be adopted. This raises the prestige of both families because both are seen to be prioritizing the education of the child -- a lofty goal in society’s eyes.




\section*{Geography}
Mountain ranges make up the Southern half of the nation, with forested areas to the Western side, and big cities to the East. The coastline is frequently under attack by the \pShippies{}.


Cultural Foods:	Sandwiches and teas.


Sexuality and relationships:	All forms of sexuality and relationships are considered valid and good, but children are culturally expected.


Taboos/Norms:	Everyone wants to raise themselves up, stand out, achieve wealth, fame, greatness.  Large families are the norm, and each kid is seen as an opportunity, and it's an unspoken shame not to be able to afford higher education for all of your children.  It's considered unlucky to not want kids, and usually people who can't have them will adopt, and people who don't want to have them will join professions that aren't considered as safe, like the Guard, which is a police organization, or Mining, or sign up as Soldiers, any of which is considered an honorable way to not have kids.


Costuming:		Clothes are often a status symbol, working class folks likely wear loom woven clothing such as denim, cotton, etc, while middle class wear a mix of manufactured clothing that looks like professional or high end leisure clothes of today, synth clothing, and woven, as they can afford.  The wealthy wear the most fashionable of Synth clothing, which looks like shiny fabrics in flowing or fitted designs, accented by wearable or integrated Tech.  All the classes will try to show what wealth they can in their clothes, and this is often a major expense.  All classes and genders are likely to wear some flashy cosmetics and/or accessories, as they can afford.  Recently militaristic fashion has become quite exciting and popular, as people glorify the war effort, and honor soldiers.


Magic:			All magic and magical tech is regulated through the Temple.  All tech must be magically enabled, and magic is also used to infuse tech into fashionable clothes as well as in the manufacturing process of most household items.
