\name{\cBeetle{}}

You are \cBeetle{\full} (\cBeetle{\they}/\cBeetle{\them}), and 46 years old. You are a \cBeetle{\clergy} of \cTechGod{}, the patron \cTechGod{\God} of the \pTech{}, who inspires innovation and growth. You teach Religion at the \pSchool{}, and have for the last 18 years. You are incredibly knowledgeable about the Deities of \pEarth{}, and the religion derived from worship of the Pantheon, and enjoy sharing that knowledge. Still, you are ready to try for the next stage in your life, hopefully by taking over as Principal when \cPrincipal{\full} steps down at the end of the weekend.

Your life growing up in the \pTech{} was wonderful. Your family was supportive of your interest in religion, and had the financial means to grant you easy access to the church. In one program, you were assigned a pen pal from the \pFarm{} named \cMusic{\full}. The two of you hit it off, and continued to correspond long after the program ended.

Your religious studies were tremendously fulfilling, and you entered the Priesthood fairly young. You excelled in your studies, and were eventually granted the honor of taking care of the Celestial Beetles. With this new phase in your career came more time to study religion more broadly. You invested great time and effort in learning about the connections between the Gods, and between the Gods and their Avatars. A God without their Avatar would have substantially less ability to effect \pEarth{} and protect their people. It is an idle curiosity that the Giant Hummingbirds of \cFarmGod{} haven't been seen in almost a decade, and explains why the Celestial Beetles of Kero are so carefully protected. They are kept sequestered in the High Temple of Kero with elite guards and dedicated priests such as yourself watching over them day and night. 

It bothers you that your deep devotion to \cTechGod{} and your respect for the truths of your religion are not universally shared among the Priesthood, especially by \cAntiChup{\full}, \textbf{the} High \cAntiChup{\cleric}. \cAntiChup{} seems less concerned with the will of \cTechGod{} and more interested in the power and intrigue involved in more worldly affairs. such as the war between the nations. You know this war, and the betrayal of the \pShippies{} can't truly be the will of \cTechGod{}, and you feel sure that \cAntiChup{} will someday be shown the error of \cAntiChup{\their} ways. Sadly, \cAntiChup{\their} protégé \cScholarship{\full} is clearly following in \cAntiChup{\their} footsteps. \cScholarship{\They} runs errands for \cAntiChup{} all the time, including off campus (which is a big no-no). You are sure that at least part of it is illegal. If only you'd been available to sponsor an initiate before \cAntiChup{} got \cAntiChup{\their} claws into \cScholarship{}. Now the two of them are interchangeable in your mind.

As your career grew and changed, you were selected to teach at \pSchool{}. When you got there, you found to your great delight, that your childhood pen pal \cMusic{} was joining the faculty at the same time as you! While \cMusic{} can be a good-naturedly nosy, \cMusic{\they} clearly \cMusic{\have} a good heart and always make\cMusic{\plural} you laugh. You've never had a better friend. As for this year's crop of students, you've been really impressed with this\cTechStar{\full}, who won the annual TechStar competition. Although \cTechStar{\theyare} not particularly thrilled by your religion class, \cTechStar{\they} \cTechStar{\have} taken the time to be kind to everyone and asks the tough questions. \cTechStar{\They} genuinely cares about others, and you'd like to see \cTechStar{\them} go far in life. One way you can help \cTechStar{\their} career is by convincing the \pShip{} teachers and the \pTech{} advisors to rank \cTechStar{\them} highest for voting authority to direct the Storm.

You are also in a stable, long distance polyamorous relationship with \cJuniorStatesman{\full}. Polyamory isn't really a thing where you come from, but the \pShippies{} have looser relationship structures, and once \cJuniorStatesman{} proposed the idea, you never looked back. You don't see \cJuniorStatesman{\them} nearly as often as you would like, as \cJuniorStatesman{\they} only visits the school on occasion and with the war on, you can't exactly go visit the \pShip{}. The two of you make up for lost time whenever \cJuniorStatesman{\they} \cJuniorStatesman{\does} make here to visit. Neither of you currently have other relationships, though you both have had others in the past. You even think \cJuniorStatesman{} may be actively looking for one, and you are delighted to support \cJuniorStatesman{\them}. You also wouldn't mind a second relationship, but alas no one has currently expressed any interest. You and \cJuniorStatesman{} generally talk about changes to the relationship structure before implementing anything though, so if someone approaches you, you should chat with \cJuniorStatesman{} about it before agreeing to anything. That said, you do not have a relationship with veto power – it is possible to have conversations around making sure needs are still met despite a change in the relationship structure without anyone mandating the other's actions. You don't meet a whole lot of new people, except on holiday, given that you teach at the \pSc{}. You have lots of time to get to know your fellow teachers, though. Lately you've been talking more with \cEthics{\full}. You would definitely enjoy spending more time with \cEthics{\them}.

Having been a teacher of religion almost as long as you have been a \cBeetle{\cleric}, you are enormously honored and excited that \cPrincipal{} is considering you to be \cPrincipal{\their} successor as Principal of the \pSchool{}. It looks like either you or \cMusic{} will be securing the promotion by the end of the weekend. Each of you has been given a task usually performed by the Principal, and yours is the management of the powerful ritual used to renew the Ley Lines that support the school and spread magic throughout the lands. You are an expert in wrangling people and ensuring that complex processes go off without a hitch, so you are confident that you can impress \cPrincipal{} and ensure that the Ley Lines are at full strength. Strengthening the Ley Lines will require a (temporary) sacrifice of magical power. You feel a bit salty about the fact that \cMusic{}'s assignment, overseeing the Ceremony of Excellence, doesn't require such a sacrifice, but the Ley Lines must be maintained and you are determined to impress \cPrincipal{}, so there is nothing for it. You also plan to help the Librarian with the preparations for the even more important Ritual to Direct the Storm, which should help your chances too.

Returning to the subject of religion, one year ago while you were home on break, you received a private message from one of the Celestial Beetles! You never would have thought yourself an appropriate recipient, what with your job at the college meaning you had to give up taking care of the Beetles, but apparently Kero thought otherwise? The message simply said, ``bring me with you, but don't tell'' so you did. Smuggling the Beetle out past the guards wasn't easy, but you managed it. 

The Beetle has provided you with many small messages this past year that have been helpful. One of the most noteworthy messages was that something is wrong with the Avatar of \cEbbFull{\full}. You want to help somehow, but you aren't sure how to approach the \pShip{} Clerics, \cEbbPriest{\full} and \cFlowPriest{\full}. They are probably trying to keep the matter quiet, and would not be pleased that you know. After all, a sick or wounded Avatar is a situation many would love to capitalize on.

While all of the Beetle's messages have been useful, you have a sense that something about this weekend, the Time of Deciding, is the true reason it is here with you. Afterward, it will have to go home. Of course, IF you become the principal, you can't be the one to take it home - it's the downside of becoming Principal. As long as you serve in that role, you cannot leave the school grounds without terrible consequences to the school. You would need to give the Beetle to another Priest of Kero\ldots{} except you don't trust  \cAntiChup{} or \cScholarship{}. For the last week, you've been scouting around for a Priest that you can trust to take the Beetle safely back to the \pTech{}, to no avail. There was no one you trust that you could manage to get on the advisor roster in time. However, you're in a unique position to recommend a replacement Cleric (must be at least 21 years old). If you find someone you deem worthy, you can essentially fast-track their religious career to replace you, and send the Beetle home with them. And you just may have a candidate for that – \cHeadScientist{\full}. You wrote to \cHeadScientist{} years ago about taking up the religious mantle and got a less than promising response, but now \cHeadScientist{\they} seem to have changed \cHeadScientist{\their} tune. If you can successfully induct \cHeadScientist{}, that takes care of returning the Beetle safely to your nation -- IF \cHeadScientist{\theyare} trustworthy. To measure \cHeadScientist{}'s trustworthiness and faith, you have encouraged \cHeadScientist{\them} to work with \cEbbPriest{} on a research project, the Creation of \pEarth{}. The Creation of \pEarth{} necessarily lies in the ancient pre-history of \pEarth{}, before your world was even created, and it has always fascinated you. You and \cEbbPriest{} have long corresponded about it. You are eager to learn what the group discovers, but also intend to demonstrate your delegation skills to \cPrincipal{} by not micromanaging \cHeadScientist{} in the process. 

This weekend will be a full one. Beating your friend \cMusic{} to the principalship and all of the difficulty that goes with the new role will be one thing. Getting the Celestial Beetle home safely will be another. At the end of the day though, the thing that will make you happiest is spending time with \cJuniorStatesman{} whenever you have the chance. 

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Spend time with \cJuniorStatesman{}.
	\item Win the promotion to Principal. To this end, ensure the ritual to restore the Ley Lines is completed successfully, and that preparations for the Ritual to Control the Storm go off without a hitch, including making sure that no one harms or misuses the six Relics.
	\item Find a Cleric of Kero you trust to bring the Celestial Beetle back to \pTech{} with them. Right now, evaluating \cHeadScientist{}'s worthiness to become a \cHeadScientist{\clergy} of \cTechGod{} seems like your best bet. But it only works if you win the principalship!
	\item Make sure the Storm does not get sent to the Free People's Federation. Help \cTechStar{} win the most voting authority to direct the Storm by convincing the \pShip{} teachers and the \pTech{} advisors to rank \cTechStar{\them} highest.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item The ritual to restore the ley lines is critical for maintaining the School and ensuring that magic continues to flow throughout \pEarth{}.  It would be terrible if something were to disrupt the ritual or endanger the \pSc{} – without \pSc{}, the ley lines would be irreparably damaged and then who knows what would happen. Maybe magic would go haywire, or even cease to function at all!
	\item You teach religion, covering all aspects of the woship of the Pantheon of \pEarth{}n Deities. You pride yourself on your objectivity when teaching despite being a \cBeetle{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}.
	\item You were not at the school six years ago when tragedy struck and twelve students perished. You had gone home to be with your family, since the Storm was expected to strike the Free People's Federation and you wanted to be with them, just in case.
	\item  Any magitech device, regardless of who made it, but \emph{especially} if it is made by \pTech{} citizens, must be empowered by a Clerics of \cTechGod{} according to Church doctrine. Any device that is activated by another means is both illegal and blasphemous. Sometimes wonder if this doctrine is too strict, and stifles innovation\ldots{}
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
