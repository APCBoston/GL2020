\name{\cAmbition{}}

You are \cAmbition{\full} (he/him), and 20 years old. It's your second year at College of the Gods, so you've had ample opportunity to learn what strings you need to pull to come out on top.You pride yourself on your ambition and drive, and you're smart enough to play your cards right reliably. While others have had position, power, and connections handed to them, everything you have you earned yourself through hard work and the will of \cTechGod{}. No one you grew up with would ever have imagined that you would make it to the \pSchool{}, coming as you do from a large family of meager means. But you proved them wrong, broke through barrier after barrier, and your family could not be more proud. It has long been your ambition to achieve greatness for yourself so that you can give back to your loving parents and help support your younger siblings, and so far your future looks bright enough to ensure that and much more. But as amazing as that is, you know you can go farther still – because now, due to your diligent prayers, offerings, and personal dedication, you have been granted the opportunity of a lifetime.

Your best friend \cHeir{\full}, the heir of the elite Faledon family, has always felt trapped by the constraints of that destiny. At first you thought \cHeir{\they} \cHeir{\were} just a whining, spoiled child, despite being a year older than you. But as you got to know \cHeir{\them}, better you realized that the truth is quite different. \cHeir{} is smart enough to know that the power wielded by the Faledon family should not be handled lightly, or by one reluctant to the task. You were stunned, and incredibly honored when \cHeir{}, seriousness etched in every line of \cHeir{\their} face, asked you to take the position in \cHeir{\their} place. \cTechGod{} had favored you once again. \cHeir{} explained that if the two of you could get the right pieces in place, there was a ritual that would make you into an equivalently valid heir to the family. Then it's just a matter of convincing the Faledon family representative, \cDiplomat{\full}. This will free \cHeir{} to live life \cHeir{\their} way, and place into your hands the power to run the industry leading Faledon Tech and Manufacturing Company. Better still, the position comes with the Faledon's seat on the government's Council, meaning you would be a central part of your country's government! As eager as \cHeir{} is to leave the job, your own eagerness to take it on and do it well is tenfold stronger. 

However, an uncooperative Faledon family could stymie your efforts even if you do technically become the Heir, so you will need to prove to them that you have a lot to offer. You need to take every opportunity this weekend to push yourself into the thick of politics, economics, and every other avenue of power. In terms of politics, \cDiplomat{}, the famous diplomat who forged the current treaty between the \pTech{} and the \pFarm{}, will be present this weekend. While \cHeir{} is eager to avoid \cDiplomat{\them} due to their close ties with the Faledon family, you will want to curry favor with this influential person who will no doubt be reporting well or ill of you back to the Faledon family once your plan to become the heir bears fruit. Additionally, considering \cDiplomat{}'s presence, there's bound to be international affairs of great importance occurring, possibly even a conclusion to the war. You've got to get in on whatever meetings are occurring and contribute in such a way that \cDiplomat{} will take note and be impressed by you. In terms of economic opportunities, if you can bring a new invention to the Faledon family for mass production, it would showcase your talent. Unfortunately, you have nothing of your own on hand – your skills lie much more in the realms of politics and social maneuvering than they do in engineering. It is preferable, however, that any invention you choose to champion does not do anything illegal by any of the three nations' laws; you have no desire to embroil your soon-to-be company in any negative press or sticky legal situations. Maybe you can convince the Faledon family to reconsider the Council vote to limit \cTechStar{\full}'s VidCom devices to the war effort if \cTechStar{} agrees to an exclusive distribution deal with the Faledons.

There is of course also the matter of voting in the Ritual to Control the Storm, which is the whole reason for this weekend's events and guests. You've already volunteered to help with the preparations for the Ritual, overseen by the Librarian \cLibrarian{\full}, as this is a prime opportunity to earn recognition and hopefully connections. You might have to jockey a bit with some of the other students to make sure you stand out as the most competent, but that's just par for the course. In terms of the Ritual itself, you plan to win the highest rank among the \pTech{} students, which would earn you extra power and prestige. To do this, you'll need to gain the favor of the teachers and advisors, who decide which students rank highest in voting authority. You're the underdog here, but that never stopped you before. There is also, of course, the matter of which way you'll vote to direct the Storm. Perhaps that's a piece of power you can bargain with to gain favor where you need it.

You're also looking forward to the opportunity to participate in this year's Ceremony of Excellence, which \cMusic{\full} is organizing. The combat demonstration presents a great opportunity for you – not only as a way to present your prodigious magical skill to the world, but also to demonstrate your ability to exert the influence needed to get selected. You'll need to be proactive to make sure you are one of the students chosen by \cMusic{}. Perhaps you can get your good friend \cChupStudent{\full} to participate as well? \cChupStudent{} at first glance is not particularly intelligent -- but in reality, \cChupStudent{\they} \cChupStudent{\are} much stronger and smarter than \cChupStudent{\they} let\cChupStudent{\plural} on. You don't  understand this stance in the least -- what benefit does someone get by hiding their true competence and missing out on the opportunities that competence can bring? Perhaps getting \cChupStudent{\them} to show off a little is just what \cChupStudent{\they} need\cChupStudent{\plural} to break that bad habit. On the other hand, maybe \cChupStudent{} is on to something. \cChupStudent{\They} laze\cChupStudent{\plural} about most of the time, but somehow \cChupStudent{\are} still the top contender for voting authority among the \pFarm{} students, above \cChupStudent{\their} seemingly more diligent compatriots.

This weekend is set to be the deciding moment for the most crucial pieces in the puzzle that is your young life. It will take everything you've got to bring this all together. Make your offerings, get to work, and you can claim more than was ever in the cards for one such as yourself. As well you know, determination, luck, and connection are the three keys to power, and you have the skills to command them all in this most crucial moment in time.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Complete a ritual with \cHeir{} to become the Faledon Heir, and see if you can score some marketable tech to impress the Faledons.
	\item Gain the highest Voting Authority for the Ritual to Control the Storm by getting the \pTech{} advisors and \pShip{} teachers to rank you highest.
	\item Get involved in the meetings \cDiplomat{} attends and make a positive impact and impression.
	\item Prove your worth and skill by taking a lead role in preparations for the Ritual to Control the Storm.
	\item Manipulate the selection process to get yourself, and perhaps \cChupStudent{}, selected for the combat demonstration during the Ceremony of Excellence.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item None.

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cHeir{}} The Faledon Heir, and your friend, with whom you have a plan to trade fates, so to speak.
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} The Diplomat from \pTech{} who originally formed the treaty with the \pFarm{}. \cDiplomat{\they} \cDiplomat{\have} strong ties to the Faledon family, and \cDiplomat{\theyare} the most important person to impress this weekend.
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} A friend and confidante who adopts a perplexing facade of weakness and stupidity. It's probably time to break \cChupStudent{\them} out of that shell.
	\contact{\cMusic{}} The Music teacher at \pSchool{} who is organizing the Ceremony of Excellence.
	\contact{\cTechStar{}} A fellow student, this year's Tech Star competition winner, and inventor of the long distance communication VidCom devices. Perhaps you can broker a distribution deal between \cTechStar{\them} and the Faledons?
