Free People's Federation %AKA Technocracy

The Free People's Federation is a nation of dreamers, inventors, and artists.  Located in the northern portion of Cengea, and separated from the AGRARIAN nation by a mountain range, the Free people live in a vibrant and beautiful nation whose natural vistas and vast urban centers inspire creativity in all who see them.  The Federation, while seen both nationally and internationally as a beacon of technology and the arts, struggles with the inherent economic class and income differences imposed by capitalism and competition.  Nine years ago the Free People were on the brink of inventing tech that would allow for the permanent removal of storms, while still retaining the use of magic.  With the promise of this new technology, they formed a new alliance with the Children of the Sun, with whom they agreed to send the storms exclusively towards L'eau, so that the two nations could have the available resources to pursue this invention.  In the aftermath of this betrayal, the L'eau declared war on both of the allied nations in hopes of claiming safe land and punishing those who had wronged them.  The war has come at terrific cost, as the L'eau are far better equipped for war.

Government:  The Free People's Federation is run by a group of officials, led by an Arbiter. Some are appointed, and some are elected to represent various self governing groups like the guilds.  This Council makes the laws and everyday decisions needed to maintain a thriving culture and economy, but bows to the authority of the Temple where the governance of magic is concerned.  The Council appeals to the Temple on behalf of the people to further tech, magic, and the arts.  They also orchestrate the provision of universal health care, basic income, education, career placement and matchmaking services.
%insert names of Council Members%

Such students usually go on to work for Faledon Industries.
						Economist:	The head of the Economics department of the Free People's National Bank.
						Educator:		Every two years the Heads of Schools elect one of their number to represent them.  The current Educator has been reelected eight times so far, and is likely to be so again.

	%Check up on flow after tweaks. ADD WAR
Economy:		Technological inventions are prototyped by an inventor, approved by the Temple, enabled by a
						Magician, Licensed and Granted by the Gov't, manufactured by various means, and sold by 
						various means.  Scientists are researchers who study magic as it applies to tech and the world, 
						often on fringes. Such abstract science often lacks immediate economic value 
						so they usually work for Temple or Gov't.  Art is valued highly and aesthetic and design are marks
						of status.  Acting, writing, painting, harmonious garden design, etc., all are paid highly.
						Education is free through general ed schools that keep kids until they are 15.  After that, there
						are private and gov't run schools that teach trades, but these cost money, more or less depending 
						on specialty.  Scholarships exist only for the exceptional.  The recent war with the L'eau has 
						cost both lives and resources as well as inciting civil unrest, as the poorest have been hit 
						hardest by the war.  The elites are concerned at the state of the economy, which is showing 
						signs of instability.
	Trade:		National:		Arts:		Performance, Fashion Design, Art Pieces, etc.
												Tech:		VidCom devices, many modern amenities, toasters, wearable tech clothes, 
													medical tech, etc
												Magic:		Magicking items so that anyone can use them, Enabling Prototypes,
													Manufacturing, and Work Mages who are in various industries ie. construction 
													where they use skills to ease, enhance, or enable work.
												Service:		All forms of service industry, including sales.
						International:		Art, performance, and fashion are the primary exports, includes many portraits 
												of agrarian queen, novels and luxuries for overlords, small tech like lights and 
												most big Tech is kept back, however in last 20 years there has been a gradual increase
												in farming tech sold to Agrarians, so now they are more reliant on it.  GMO seeds,
												Irrigation, food preservation tech, plant diagnosis and treatment, healing devices 
												for people, weather prediction, water conservation tech, cooking tech, etc.  All 
												trade with the L'eau stopped when the war began, although there is some black market
												trade occurring that the officials have not yet been able to thwart.
	Major Industries:  VidCom and other tech devices, Manufacturing, Marketing, Banking, Higher Education, 
									Theater, Fashion, education, etc.
	
Politics:
	National: Council governs, and are balanced by the Temple, which regulates magical devices.
	International:  Allied closely with Children of the Sun, at war with L'eau.
	
Religion:		Free People follow Koro, the God of Knowledge and Inspiration.  Church strictly regulates use of
						magic, limitations on technology.  They do this in the interest of maintaining freedom and 
						equality for the people.  
	Consequences:  Koro punishes the following crimes among his followers:  Murder, kidnapping, major 
						Intellectual Property theft, and Scam artistry are punished with memory loss.  Unregulated 
						magical enchantment of technology punished by lifetime inability to use tech or magic.  
						Smaller crimes lead to temporary memory loss, or temp tech ban, or a mark on the forehead 
						that brings social shame.
	Hierarchy:  Circle of Five highest Officers of the Temple govern according to a written conscriptus of
						religious laws.
	
	
Biological features:	Tend to have dark hair that varies between wavy and tightly curly, and dark eyes.

%MOVE THE ``this is impossible'' part to individual character sheets
National History:		9 years ago formed alliance with Agrarians.  Agrarians give Free People a better deal on food, and vote storms to Vikings, in exchange Free People will invent way to permanently stop storms, while maintaining magic.  %This is now known to be impossible, and we don't want the Agrarians to find out.  We are getting desperate and trying more and more risky methods to try to create a way to make this deal work and cover our lie.  We've been working so hard on inventing a solution that we aren't properly fortified so if a storm hits us it would be a disaster.
	Storms:		T-6 should have been ours, hit vikings.  Kids who did this vote seen as heroes, but were murdered at the school after the vote.  They are honored and remembered by the entire nation as well as their families. %(Move to individual sheets) Teachers suspect was not accident.
						T-15
						T-24
						T-33
						Nonrotation
	
Education:	Public schooling until 15, then private specialized education.  Children of poorer families can petition wealthier families to be adopted to get access to education. This raises the prestige of both families because both are seen to be prioritizing the education of the child.

Technology:		VidCom devices were recently invented in the annual Tech Star competition, hoverboards that operate over tracks in roads, toasters and household appliances, wearable tech in clothes, etc.  

Geography:	Mountain range make up the Southern half of the nation, with forested areas to the Western side, and big cities to the East. The coastline is frequently under attack by the L'eau.

Cultural Foods:	Sandwiches and teas.

Sexuality and relationships:	All forms of sexuality and relationships are considered valid and good, but children are culturally expected.

Taboos/Norms:		Everyone wants to raise themselves up, stand out, achieve wealth, fame, greatness.  Large families are the norm, and each kid is seen as an opportunity, and it's an unspoken shame not to be able to afford higher education for all your children.  It's considered unlucky to not want kids, and usually people who can't will adopt, and people who don't want to have them will join professions that aren't considered as safe, like the Guard, which is a police organization, or Mining, etc which is considered an honorable way to not have kids.

Costuming:		Clothes are often a status symbol, working class folks likely wear loom woven clothing such as denim, cotton, etc, while middle class wear a mix of manufactured clothing that looks like professional or high end leisure clothes of today, synth clothing, and woven, as they can afford.  The wealthy wear the most fashionable of Synth clothing, which looks like shiny fabrics in flowing or fitted designs, accented by wearable or integrated Tech.  All the classes will try to show what wealth they can in their clothes, and this is often a major expense.  All classes and genders are likely to wear some flashy cosmetics and/or accessories, as they can afford.  Recently militaristic fashion has become quite exciting and popular, as people glorify the war effort, and honor soldiers.

Magic:	All magic and magical tech is regulated through the Temple.  All tech must be magically enabled, and
magic is also used to infuse tech into fashionable clothes as well as in the manufactuing process of most household items.
