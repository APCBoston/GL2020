%Jessie AKA WR Teacher ChupSecond

Jessie knows that Aaron has done things (betrayal) like this before, trying to convince Chris against Aaron (reference The Science is a lie)


%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the character's current life, problems, and priorities. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life. Current life and situation.   What they think about the most important contacts

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.

Second in the cult - L'eau Bishop. She is loyal to the FoG, and aware that simply blowing Aaron's cover will destroy the cult - but she still wants to be in charge. She wants to summon the avatar to get direct guidance from Genesis. The leader of the ritual is the one who can talk to Genesis - the claim to leadership is vs Aaron, who is the current leader - but Jessie did all the work. Jessie isnt sure now is the right time to destroy magic....		"Chupacabra, backstab aaron
Make sure the Leau avatar is -not- resurrected
Summon the FoG avatar"
