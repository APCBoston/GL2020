\name{\cAdopted{}}

You are \cAdopted{}.  At 19 years old, you are a First Year student at \pSchool{}.  You grew up in \pFarm{}, but your family life is\ldots complicated.  Forcibly adopted into a noble family at a young age, you yearn to undo the despicable norms in your country that led to your kidnapping by the Nobility who could supposedly provide better for you than those who truly love you, and you'll do anything to find your true family. You are determined to punish the ones who took you, and use the great magical potential that you were born with to better the lives of the farming families across \pFarm{} whether the \cQueen{\Majesty} and the Nobility like it or not.

You were born into a poor family that farmed the lands under the rule of \cAdoptedParentOne{}, but when your magical potential was discovered you were promptly ``adopted'' into the Noble family.  Your new so-called family told you it was for your own best interest and that they could give you a life and education that your birth family could never provide.  In reality, you never felt truly included - your new siblings made it clear to you when you were first taken in that you were there for your magical potential alone and your other relatives always treated you as second best.  Never did they make you feel truly loved, like a real family would.  You hate the people who kept you from your true family and the love and belonging you’ve craved all your life, and you've got plans for revenge.  

You were a young child, still living with the birth family you can barely remember, when the Storm struck \pFarm{}, devastating your region and killing a number of people.  The memory of clinging to your mother’s hand and looking at the bodies, laid out like broken dolls awaiting burial, still haunts you.  To this day, you still have nightmares about it that never fail to leave you shaken and feeling helpless.  As a student at the \pSchool{}, it now falls upon you and your fellow magically powerful students to direct the terrifying Storms.  Luckily, the \pSchool{} has bunkers to protect the students, and they should be in good working order\ldots right?  Oh Gods, what if they aren't?  No, surely there are people on top of their maintenance\ldots Yes, of course everything will be fine. You'll be fine. But maybe you should go check, just in case??

Ahem.

After so many years apart from your birth family and in the hands of people who never truly loved you, you are starved for the feeling of connection and being a part of something. You’ve felt this sense of something missing all of your life, but have never had an outlet for it.  Out from under your adopted family’s room for the first time, this has led to the increasingly strong desire to reconnect with your birth family and repudiate your kidnappers. You know that \cAdoptedParentOne{} would never approve, and the rest of the family would conspire to prevent you from doing so, so you must work in secret. You have heard rumors of these things called ``vid-com'' devices in the \pTech{}. These devices are not yet available to the general public, but allow for communication between two people who each hold one of these devices. If only you could get your hands on a pair, you could keep one for yourself, and smuggle one to your birth family. Finding such items when they aren't generally available will be tricky - you'll probably have to find a way to access the black market. And then there's the matter of money. While you aren't exactly hurting for pocket money, you suspect that the black market is likely to trade on things other than \pFarm{} currency. You are more than prepared to break rules or take on personal sacrifice to make this happen.

Of course, once you’ve found the devices, you'll still have to \emph{find} your birth family to give them one of these devices once the weekend is done - and convince them to take them, keep them secret, and love you again. They have to want to do that, though, right? After all, if you can’t belong with them, there isn’t anywhere else you really belong\ldots right?  The desire to be with your birth family again is like an ache in your chest, but you know you should keep your eye out for any other community you might be able to belong to - because if this doesn’t work, you don’t know WHAT you’ll do.

Beyond the immediate goals of finding and communicating with your birth family, you feel driven to improve the lives of your family and all those like them, who are so often ignored, neglected, or abused by the Nobility.  Healing magic, which comes in the form of enchanted music, is provided only by the Priesthood, and then only with the approval of whatever capricious Noble deems the recipient worthy.  If only you could devise a way to record the healing music and get it into the hands of the farmers who truly need it, you could improve the lives of so many - even save lives the next time the Storms hit \pFarm{} again!  The nobility remain safe within their walls, a dedicated Priest always on hand, while those who actually \emph{work} the land face the Storms unprotected.  You won't let the fact that these ideas are ``seditious''  stop you.

You also have one more, somewhat more sinister goal - getting revenge for the wrongs done to you by your kidnappers.  With the help of your good friend \cLibAssist{}, you’ve come up with a plan to curse your entire adoptive family’s line with a wasting curse. This curse will render food tasteless, bland, and most importantly, devoid of nutrition. Until you decide to lift the curse, your entire kidnapping family above the age of 15 will slowly waste away, despite their best efforts. You don’t intend to wipe them out - just make them confront their own helplessness in the face of a greater power, just like you have had to, and perhaps provide you some concessions in order to release them. The arrival and assistance of \cCurse{} will provide a key component of your plan, and is the biggest reason you have to complete it this weekend.  The biggest wrinkle in this plan is that your kidnappers are related to \cMusic{} and you know that \cMusic{theyare} a good sort. As such, you’ve gone to significant trouble to start the preparations for a counterspell for \cMusic{\them} that can lift the effects only for a single person. No need to punish the good with the bad.

Of course, to hold on to any advances you make, and to make it through the destruction of your ``adoptive family'', you'll need to start building your own base of authority outside of your ``adopted'' family. Many of the most powerful and successful people in the \pFarm{} are alumni of the \pSchool{}. Having the most votes among the \pFarmers{} students would indicate that you have the favor of the teachers, the advisors, and \cFarmGod{}. You'd be well on your way to carving out a place for yourself in \pFarm{} society, from which you could implement all kinds of improvements. Which is to say nothing of how much peace of mind it would give you to be able to personally direct the storm away from your home. You don't want any other children from your country to have to go through the same fear and terror you did.

What was otherwise shaping up to be a quiet end to the year has gotten more complicated thanks to your friends \cDisney{} and \cPirateChild{}. They approached you a few weeks ago with somewhat of a dilemma. The two of them had gotten ahold of a sea serpent egg, and actually decided to keep and hatch it! You can't leave those two alone for 5 seconds before they do something ridiculous. 

The magically inclined members of your ``adopted'' family specialize in charms of protection, primarily illusions of the highest quality that make one thing look like another. Willingly or not, you learned the family trade, and are adept both at creating such charms and spotting them on objects, though breaking such enchantments is something you are still practicing.  To keep \cDisney{} and \cPirateChild{} from getting in trouble, you agreed to use your magic to disguise the sea serpent egg as a rock. But now it's hatched!  Casting illusions on living things is -much- harder. The illusions don't last nearly as long, and anything the creature does will be modeled in the image. How can they explain a stuffed animal that begs for table scraps?

All in all, despite the various obstacles and troubles, you’re hopeful that you’ll be able to make meaningful connections with your real family, improve their lives with healing magic, and punish those who have wronged you.  All you’ve got to do is survive the storm, and not get kicked out for helping to hide a sea serpent.
