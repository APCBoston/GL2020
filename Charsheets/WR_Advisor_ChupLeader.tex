\name{\cChupLeader{}}

You are \cChupLeader{\full} (\cChupLeader{\they}/\cChupLeader{\them}), and the inspiring, visionary, charismatic leader of the \pGoaties{}. This is your moment to elevate your patron \cGenesis{\God} \cGenesis{} to the level of the patron Deities of each of the countries, as well as liberate the world from the corrupting influence of magic. All you have to do is a mess with the established rituals -- and not get caught doing it.

You grew up in the \pShip{}, in 9th fleet. Ninth fleet is one of the poorest parts of the country, despite bordering the \pFarm{}. The trade was bad, the fishing was bad - just about everything was bad. You attended 9th Fleet academy - if you could even call that bottom-of-the-barrel place an academy, worthless as the credentials are. You and your ship scraped by -- but just barely. Many of your friends; and even more of your ship, never had enough to eat. So much for a country of balance. Where was the spot at the banquet table for you and yours?

From a very young age, you stayed up late into the night, asking any deity who would listen why, WHY was this your lot in life? You were smart, charismatic, and talented! Yet because of where you were born, you were left to languish on the bottom rung of society. Long nights of contemplation brought you to realize that the reason for your pain was distressingly simple. The richer, more prosperous fleets had the resources to attract the best mages, who brought more wealth to the fleets that employed them. The mages strengthened the fleets and their social and financial position, intermingled, and gave birth to more strong mages, who stayed with those fleets. The self perpetuating system gave rise to closed circles of society that could never be breached -- with you on the outside. Looking abroad gave you no hope either; this pattern was present the world over, no matter how meritocratic a country claimed to be. And at its very heart was \emph{magic}, the great unbalancer, the force that allowed this unjust system to perpetuate with no hope of revolution. The force with which the world could never be at peace. For years, you stewed in the problem, able to do nothing to change your plight or that of so many others\ldots{}

But that all changed suddenly, just over 10 years ago. Deep in the night, you heard a voice whisper in the dark. It was a quiet voice at first, a voice of something afraid to be caught where it was not welcome. After you listened, you recognized it for what it was -- the savior you had been looking for. The \cGenesis{\God} called \cGenesis{} was speaking directly in your ear about a better way. \cGenesis{} was a very minor \cGenesis{\God} of luck, one almost no one had heard of in a millenia, one who had been cast aside just like you - but \cGenesis{} had big plans. And \cGenesis{\they} needed your help to make them a reality. One harrowing blood ritual later, and \cGenesis{} was able to free you from the smothering influence of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}, and make you \cGenesis{\their} first acolyte.

Under the protection of \cGenesis{} alone, you began to move through the poor, lonely, and forgotten of \pEarth{}. You brought what little comforts you could, material and spiritual, using your own personal brand of subtle, persuasive magic to smooth the way and ease the burdens of the downtrodden. (In the subtlety, you are not so different from many \pShippies{}.) Of those you helped, some chose to follow you. Little by little, the group that you would come to call themselves the \pGoaties{} grew. \cChupSecond{\full} was one of your first followers, and by far the most capable, quickly rising to become your right hand. Embittered by a life of crushing poverty and little magical talent, \cChupSecond{}'s loyalty to the group was absolute. \cChupSecond{\They} complemented your divine vision and charisma magic with \cChupSecond{\their} ability to turn it into reality. Between the two of you, the \pGoaties{} grew by leaps and bounds -- and now finally you are ready to move onto the world stage.

\cChupInventor{\full} was another of your earliest recruits, a brilliant inventor from the \pTech{} whose designs had been thwarted by the narrow minded Clerics of \cTechGod{}, who refused to approve \cChupSecond{\their} greatest invention – ``refrigeration coils.'' Having such a skilled engineer in your ranks proved instrumental to the growth of the movement, as you quickly turned the sorry excuse for a black market that already existed into a force to be reckoned with. The Black Market, overseen by \cChupSecond{} and \cChupInventor{}, proved to be an invaluable revenue stream, means of moving agents and equipment around discreetly, and above all, source of exploitable secrets about your enemies. 

One of your most socially privileged recruits is \cChupStudent{\full}, second child of the powerful \cChupStudent{\formal} family of the \pFarm{}. Five years ago, you were in the \pFarm{} working to recruit from their disaffected peasants. As \emph{luck} would have it, a barn caught fire just as you arrived on the scene. This allowed you to rescue the children who had been playing inside and curry favor with the local populace. You began preaching the word of \cGenesis{}, but then some noble brat and \cChupStudent{\their} retainers showed up halfway through, and you thought you were going to be arrested for sedition. But instead, your words (and a touch of charisma magic) got through to \cChupStudent{}, and \cChupStudent{\they} became a secret class traitor and one of your most loyal followers. \cChupStudent{\Their} age and social status has proved invaluable, as it means you finally managed to place a student at the \pSchool{}.

In preparation for your next big move, a few years ago you leveraged the luck of \cGenesis{} and a few touches of charisma magic to land a very prestigious position for someone of your background -- secretary to \cHeadDiplomat{\full}, one of the \pShip{}'s leading diplomats. \cHeadDiplomat{\They} \cHeadDiplomat{\were} working in Fleets 8, 9 and 10 at the time, to try to reduce the pirate threat. Mere days after you began your position as \cHeadDiplomat{}'s secretary, a notorious pirate ship, the Silent Fog, tried (and failed) to kidnap \cHeadDiplomat{\them}; you are almost certain that one of the students at the school this weekend, \cPirateChild{\full}, was on that ship, which could prove to be useful leverage. Although how \cPirateChild{\they} got here is beyond you. From your position as \cHeadDiplomat{}'s secretary, you have had a much greater ability to move about in the world, collect information, and position your people where they can have the greatest effect. 

As your plans grew bolder, one of your most versatile tools has been Avengers -- group members who act as assassins, but without the usual drawbacks. Through the power of \cGenesis{}, rather than the Avenger losing their memory, they are forgotten by others in their lives instead. This powerful tool has made assassinations an integral part of your strategy. It was the judicious use of one such Avenger that recently protected your position as an advisor \pSc{} today, and prevented catastrophe. Your diplomat boss, \cHeadDiplomat{}, was on the verge of discovering your association with the \pGoaties{}, and had to be neutralized immediately. It was a win-win — either \cHeadDiplomat{} would be killed, or \cHeadDiplomat{\they} would be forced to kill in self defense and be punished with total amnesia by the Gods. Either way, \cHeadDiplomat{\they} and \cHeadDiplomat{\their} suspicions would be out of the picture, unable to attend the proceedings this weekend, leaving you as the foremost authority on \cHeadDiplomat{}'s plans for the negotiation. 

What you did not expect was that \cEbbPriest{\full}, the  \cEbbPriest{\cleric} heading up the investigation into the assassination attempt, would declare \cEbbPriest{\themself} the new leader of the \pShip{} diplomatic delegation. Still, that at least keeps \cEbbPriest{\them} distracted from the investigation, so you'll just need to make sure that \cHeadDiplomat{}'s apprentice, \cJuniorStatesman{\full}, doesn't dig too deeply into the assassination attempt; your best bet is probably to offer to lead the investigation yourself. \cEbbPriest{} has ordered you and \cJuniorStatesman{} to keep what happened to \cHeadDiplomat{} secret; the only other person who knows is the fourth \pShip{} advisor, \cBunker{\full}.
 
Now that you and your other operatives are positioned here at the school, it is finally time for the coup de grâce. It is time to rewrite the rules of the world to be more fair, equitable, and magic free. Everything hinges on the Storm. Most people, including most \pGoaties{}, believe that the only valid targets for the storm are the three nations. But you and a tight circle of other \pGoaties{} have consecrated a new Relic, the \iHorseshoe{}, that is attuned to the \pSchool{} (allowing the storm to target the \pSc{} if it is used in the ritual). Your group's ostensible goal this weekend is to use the Storm to destroy the school as a blow against the current Pantheon and political structures of \pEarth{}. In reality, the plan goes two steps further -- destroying the \pSc{} will also end all magic on \pEarth{} by virtue of destroying the Ley Lines running through it, and the school's destruction will also serve as an assassination of many of the assembled dignitaries. Only you and \cChupSecond{} know this. You've kept it from \textbf{literally} everyone else present. With all magic gone from the world, the followers of the other Deities will quickly turn to despair, and many will forsake the Deities who have forsaken them. But the \pGoaties{}, having prepared for a near apocalypse scenario, will ride out the turmoil comparably unscathed. And when the dust settles, there will be five patron Deities, not four.

To make this work, you need to a Relic attuned to the school is used in the Ritual to Control the Storm, either by installing the Relic you have constructed – the \iHorseshoe{} – or by re-attuning one of the other Relics. In this you have the help of \cChupInventor{}, whose technical expertise should prove useful. You'll have to watch out for the Clerics of each nation, though, as with some effort they will be able to tell if the Relics have been tampered with. If you are unable to install a Relic attuned to the \pSc{} in the Ritual to Control the Storm, there is a backup plan: Genesis has revealed to you that if the preparations for the Ritual to Control the Storm, the Ritual to Renew the Leylines, and the Ceremony of Excellence are disrupted such that all three fail, then the school will be a valid target for the Storm anyway. Only you know this right now. It is up to you whether to disseminate this information to your followers. Sabotaging the preparations for all three rituals would be no easy task (possibly harder than plan A), so hopefully you will be able to install a corrupted Relic instead. 

The second part of your plan requires getting enough \emph{votes} for the Storm to target the school. Only the students are able to vote, but you have a loyal Follower of \cGenesis{} among the students, \cChupStudent{}, which is a good start. Personally, you are very interested in \cInitiate{\full}. \cInitiate{\They} \cInitiate{\have} the stink of a Bad Luck Curse upon them. Stupid \pFarm{} cursemakers thinking they can encroach on \cGenesis{}' domain. Maybe you could help them with that in exchange for joining the \pGoaties{}? You also know that others in the organization are targeting more students to try to bring them into the fold. And of course students get their voting power from the teachers and the advisors. You can lie, bribe, ensorcel, and blackmail any number of them to influence which students get more votes than others. And lastly, as \cGenesis{} is a \cGenesis{\God} of chance, you have a limited ability to influence the votes \textbf{after} they are cast, adding, changing, or removing some to tip the scales.

Since what you are trying to do would be\ldots{} controversial at best, it is being kept under tight wraps. You've also kept an ear out for other controversies and scandals you might be able to reveal as a distraction if needed. One such scandal was brought to you by \cChupInventor{}, and involves \cChupInventor{}'s friend, \cHeadScientist{\full}. \cHeadScientist{} has the weight of an entire nation on \cHeadScientist{\their} shoulders. \cHeadScientist{\They} \cHeadScientist{\have} been tasked with revealing a method to eliminate the storms forever, without destroying magic in \pEarth{}. You, of course, know this is impossible - you heard it from \cGenesis{}'s own lips. At the moment, you are much more interested in keeping the secret as a favor to your friend. But if you had to, you could reveal this to divert attention from your activities. After all, you've worked too hard to get here to allow moral compunctions to stay your hand. For the sake of the world, you must NOT let the \pGoaties{} be stopped. Of course, if \cHeadScientist{} were to join you, that would be a different story. Protecting a comrade is a much more noble goal. Perhaps your assistance with the coverup could help convince them\ldots{}

Meanwhile, you've heard some unpleasant rumors that hit close to home. According to these rumors, \cChupSecond{}, your oldest ally and most trusted lieutenant, is angling for the top spot in the \pGoaties{}. While \cChupSecond{} might have helped the process along, it was YOU who built the \pGoaties{} up from nothing, and YOU who are \cGenesis{}'s chosen one. You suspect that if these rumors are true, this betrayal must be out of concern for the speed at which you are trying to make your move. \cChupSecond{} has always been overly cautious. But now is no time to hesitate -- not when what you've worked for so hard is finally within your grasp. Even if this is true, though, you can't accuse your second in command without proof -- especially because if the rumors are false, you will be burning a critical bridge. You've sent \cChupStudent{} to find out if \cChupSecond{} can be trusted. You hope that if push comes to shove, \cChupStudent{} and \cChupInventor{} will remain loyal to you, and not fall for \cChupSecond{}'s overcautious rhetoric. 

This news is extra concerning because of an important duty you had entrusted to \cChupSecond{} before hearing about their possible betrayal. That duty was the summoning of the Avatar of \cGenesis{} this weekend -- something that you know from speaking with \cGenesis{} will come with a lot of favor for whoever completes the ritual. If \cChupSecond{} really intends to betray you, you need to find a way to prevent \cChupSecond{\them} from leading that ritual -- just in case that favor is exactly what \cChupSecond{\they} need\cChupSecond{\plural} to oust you. 

Partly to keep \cChupSecond{} busy and \cChupStudent{} close enough to monitor \cChupSecond{\them}, you ordered the two of them to sabotage the school's Bunkers, which they succeeded at this morning. The sabotage is intended mainly as a distraction for your enemies, who will focus their energies on repairing the Bunkers instead of your efforts to direct the Storm at the \pSc{}. As far as \cChupStudent{} and \cChupInventor{} know, the Bunkers will be repaired by the time the Storm strikes, and will be able to protect everyone assembled from the ensuing destruction — a convenient fiction to keep them in line. What only you and \cChupSecond{} know is that even if the Bunkers are repaired, they still won't be able to protect everyone from the full wrath of the Storm when it strikes the school — nearly half of those gathered here will perish. You fully intend to make sure that the corrupt, decadent advisors from the three nations are among the half that doesn't survive, making a powerful statement to your enemies. The power of Genesis will protect you and your followers with or without the Bunkers, so you have no fear.

Speaking of your followers, you have a particularly worrying issue to resolve right now with one of the personnel you stationed at the \pSc{}. You were supposed to have placed an Avenger here sometime in the past, as a backup plan in case things went wrong. But you don't remember who they are! This is a very bad sign, as it means that your Avenger may have gone rogue and killed someone they were not authorized to kill. You need to figure out who they are, and how to regain control of them if necessary.

\cGenesis{} works in mysterious ways. You got some unexpectedly good news from \cEbbPriest{} of all people this morning — apparently, the \cEbb{} Avatar has been killed, probably by someone looking to gain the upper hand in the war. Of course you pretended to be devastated when \cEbbPriest{\they} told you, but it really is a \emph{convenient} thing. Anything that weakens the other Deities, like losing their Avatar on \pEarth{} and the accompanying loss of contact with the divine, is a boon to you and \cGenesis{}. You should do everything in your power to stop them from doing anything to fix that problem.

This weekend is the culmination of years of work. You will elevate \cGenesis{} to their rightful place in the pantheon - equal to the other Deities, if not their better. You will accomplish this no matter what, by tasks both great and small, and the greatest being the destruction of the \pSchool{}, and with it, the loss of magic in all of \pEarth{}.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item End all magic in \pEarth{} to elevate \cGenesis{} to a Patron \cGenesis{\God}, by any means necessary. Make sure a Relic attuned to the school is used in the Ritual to Control the Storm and enough votes are cast for the \pSc{}, OR sabotage the Ritual to Control the Storm, the Ritual to Renew the Leylines, AND the Ceremony of Excellence in order to make the school a valid target for the Storm. Then, manipulate the students' votes to direct the Storm to the \pSc{}.
	\item Determine if \cChupSecond{} is indeed trying to oust you, and if so, deal with \cChupSecond{\them} appropriately -- including preventing \cChupSecond{\them} from being the leader of the Ritual to Summon the Avatar of Genesis.
	\item Help \cChupInventor{} cover for \cHeadScientist{} as long as it is beneficial to the \pGoaties{} to do so. Make sure \cChupInventor{} remains loyal to you, personally.
	\item Figure out who the Avenger is, why you don't remember them, and make sure they are loyal to you.
	\item Recruit or gain influence over as many students as you can in order to influence their votes for where to send the Storm. To that end, help \cInitiate{} dispel \cInitiate{\their} bad luck curse, and decide how to approach \cPirateChild{}, who you believe is secretly a pirate.
	\item Prevent \cEbbPriest{} or anyone else from resurrecting the \cEbb{} Avatar or finding another way to contact their Goddesses.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You've told the other members of the \pGoaties{} that the result of destroying the school will be only to cement \cGenesis{}'s place in the pantheon. Only you and \cChupSecond{} know that it will also end all humanity's ability to use magic, and kill off around half of those gathered at the school. You know that many people would likely be opposed to this true purpose, including \cChupInventor{} and \cChupStudent{}.
	\item You have never been to the \pSchool{} before.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cChupSecond{}} Your second in command and a teacher at the \pSc{}. \cChupSecond{\They} run\cChupSecond{\plural} the Black Market, and may not be as loyal to you as you would hope\ldots{}
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} A teacher at the \pSc{}, your confidante, and one of your oldest followers who helps run the Black Market. You don't think \cChupInventor{\they}'d react well if \cChupInventor{\they} knew that destroying the school will end all magic in Cengea.
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} A student at the school who is fanatically loyal to you as well as your cause. That said, you aren't sure how \cChupStudent{\they}'d react if \cChupStudent{\they} knew that destroying the school will kill around half of those present, even if the Bunkers are repaired, and will end all magic in Cengea.
	\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} The \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{} who is now in charge of the \pShip{} delegation.
	\contact{\cJuniorStatesman{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}'s apprentice. You have a good working relationship, and \cJuniorStatesman{} has no idea who you really are.
	\contact{\cInitiate{}} Suffers from a bad luck curse. You could help with that, possibly for a price.
\contact{\cPirateChild{}} A student at the school  who you're almost certain was a crewmember on the Silent Fog, a pirate ship that tried to kidnap \cHeadDiplomat{}. \cPirateChild{\Their} background may make \cPirateChild{\them} ripe for recruitment to the Followers of Genesis, or at least vulnerable to blackmail\ldots{}
