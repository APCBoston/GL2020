\name{\cDisney{}}


You are \cDisney{\full} (\cDisney{\they}/\cDisney{\them}), and 21 years old. Well\ldots{}technically 220, but you were asleep for most of that. You are a first year student at the \pSchool{} and you grew up in the \pFarm{} two centuries ago. As you have endured 200 years of enchanted sleep and only awoke nine months ago, the world is strange to you. Common people have access to technomagical creations, the upper class walk around in clothing woven with magic, and traveling ``circuses'' from the \pTech{} share art and music freely amongst the \pFarmers{}.

You hold a deadly secret you dare only share with those you trust deeply (details below). You've begun to make friends in your short time at \pSchool{}, \cPirateChild{\full}, \cTechStar{\full}, and \cAdopted{\full}. The four of you argue constantly, but that doesn't mean you aren't the best of friends, right? Maybe you can trust them? You have always considered yourself something of an idealist and dreamer, and hate having to carry this secret alone. When you were awakened by your benefactor \cWildCard{\full}, and subsequently invited to attend the \pSchool{}, you hoped that the additional learning would allow you to both find your own place in this modern world and help others in the process.

You grew up very poor, forced into pickpocketing, begging, and scrounging for scraps to stay alive. You spent a few dark years on the streets---until a kindly old \cDisneyMentor{\cleric} named \cDisneyMentor{} found you and took you in. Your life rapidly improved after that. You learned to read and write, and got a much more cheery outlook on life, though you never quite forgot your skills at getting into places where you didn't belong. Fortunately, that suited your mentor just fine, as \cDisneyMentor{\they} was a member of a minority religious sect within the Church of Luminary known as the Aethers. The Aethers believed it was their destiny to enter the Realm of the Gods and commune with them directly about the creation of the world and other theological questions. It sounded so exciting! You studied under \cDisneyMentor{} to become a Cleric, where your idealism and desire to help others could really shine, and after years of study, you were ordained. Only a few days later, all of the prayer and research of you and your fellow Aethers came to fruition when you attempted the most magnificent feat ever embarked upon by humankind. You had finally figured out how to make someone corporeal in the Divine Realm, and how to send someone there!

Unfortunately, before it could be realized, the ritual and the rest of your world came crashing down---you think. You don't actually remember. This part is just what \cWildCard{} has told you. The mainstream Church caught wind of the ritual and condemned it as heresy. They broke into the temple where the ritual was being attempted just in time to stop it, killing all the Clerics therein. At the last moment, \cDisneyMentor{} hid you in the Crypt below the Temple, in a glass box, lying in a sleep like death, where you remained for two hundred years. You've told two of your best friends \cPirateChild{}, \cTechStar{} a little about this, but hope that they won't spread the details too far. It's not that you meant to leave \cAdopted{} out, it just kind of happened that way. There never seemed to be a good time to come out and say ``by the way, I'm a member of a heretical splinter faction of the Church of \cFarmGod{}''

You were awakened by \cWildCard{}, who had worked for years to unravel a puzzle that eventually led \cWildCard{\them} to you. \cWildCard{}, who has become your kindly benefactor, gave you your first introduction to the modern world, and you are eternally grateful. The only item you have left from your earlier life is a locket that was given to you for safekeeping by \cDisneyMentor{}, which shines with the light of \cFarmGod{} when you open it. \cDisneyMentor{} told you that the \iLocket{} is a holy Relic, on par with other ``official'' Relics used in the ritual to direct the Storm, and you treasure it. 

Perhaps because of the catastrophic failure of the ritual with the Aethers, it is very important to you to be heavily involved and ensure the success of the ritual to control the Storm this weekend; you do not want to see the same thing happen to your new friends. Aside from your role as a voting student and the actual execution of the ritual, there is the preparation, which is always a joint effort between the students and the teachers. You intend to make yourself useful to whichever teachers are in charge of the ritual this year. 

A number of things are different now than they were 200 years ago, but most concerning to you beyond the current war is the absence of the Giant Hummingbirds, Avatars of \cFarmGod{}, which were so common in your time. The Hummingbirds used to be a cornerstone of daily life, appearing with messages of hope, faith, and inspiration to anyone who needed them. While you are perplexed at their current scarcity, you are even more alarmed by the fact that nobody seems to think this is unusual, especially given that the nations are currently at war. Of course the wars and great successes and failures of mortals influence the power of the gods, and the success of their divine labors. You are determined to discover why \cFarmGod{}'s messengers have abandoned your people in what is clearly a time of great need. You consider it your duty as \cDisney{\cleric} of Luminary, even if the mainstream Church did brand you and your fellow Aethers as heretics. 

You'd been asking around discretely for some time, finding little interest among the \pFarm{}. Close to despairing of finding any leads, or even help in your search, you wrote to several international entities, including \cHeadDiplomat{\full}. Everyone already knew the hummingbirds were missing, so it's not like you were sending sensitive information to a foreign agent in a time of war (when you put it that way, maybe it was a bit rash of you---but it worked out!). It wasn't \cHeadDiplomat{}, but their mentee, \cJuniorStatesman{\full} who replied. Despite being from the \pShip{}, \cJuniorStatesman{\they} share\nolinebreak\cJuniorStatesman{\plural} your concerns about the missing avatars. The two of you have been searching for several months to no avail. If only you could reach the Divine Realms like the Aethers originally planned, you could  ask the Hummingbirds, or even \cFarmGod{} \cFarmGod{\them}self why the Hummingbirds have departed. But the plan to reach the Divine Realm got a lot of people you called family killed, so you aren't sure you would condone another attempt\ldots{}
 
As a perhaps more immediate concern, your friend \cPirateChild{} has found a Dragon's egg, and (perhaps misguidedly) smuggled it into the school to give to you as an early present for your birthday, which is on Sunday. You are touched by the gesture\ldots{}if a little troubled by the practicalities. You aren't sure \cPirateChild{} really thought this through in terms of what you should do with such a creature in the long term, but you know \cPirateChild{\they} meant well. 

At first, everything was going smoothly. You'd gotten \cAdopted{} to cast an enchantment to disguise the egg as an innocuous stuffed animal---but of course, the little creature hatched, which dispelled the enchantment. Probably just as well---it's not like a moving stuffed animal would be a very convincing disguise. Now you have a smart, adorable, ravenously hungry little baby dragon to keep hidden (in a secret compartment behind a bookshelf in the student lounge) and fed. And to top it off, the poor thing seems to be sick, and keeps sneezing! You are determined to preserve this precious, albeit someday terrifying, creature, because the Dragons, also known as Sea Serpents, can become the Avatars of \cEbbFull{\full} and \cFlowFull{\full}. And the poor thing has no family, much like yourself\ldots{}And because it is so, so sweet. You think you could make it through this current predicament with a little luck and ingenuity.

You were recently asked a favor by \cWildCard{}, who is apparently looking for information on the existence of a Black Market. \cWildCard{\they} think\cWildCard{\plural} that \cBunker{\full} might have important information about it, so \cWildCard{\they} asked you to sneak into \cBunker{}'s room and steal paperwork from a briefcase. You haven't had to steal anything in a long time, but you feel you owe a debt to \cWildCard{} for saving you from what could easily have been permanent internment in the crypt, and you're sure \cWildCard{\they} won't misuse the information. It was a challenge, but you succeeded and now have the papers the briefcase contained! You don't know what they mean, but \cWildCard{} probably will. You want to ask \cWildCard{} to explain them to you when you turn them over though. It's not fair to take risks and not even learn anything from them. Maybe \cWildCard{} is a secret agent, trying to take down the Black Market? That would be exciting! Maybe you can become a secret agent too! Breaking into the suitcase kind of sparked something in you. You used to be so skilled at stealing things. It's been more than two centuries since you had to do so to survive, but there's a thrill in it that you miss. You kind of want to steal a voting stone from another student, just to prove you can.

You also suspect that \cWildCard{}, and probably other far less worthy individuals, would like to know more about the ill-fated ritual that you and the other Aethers tried to cast to gain entry to and become corporeal in the Realm of Gods. To \cWildCard{}'s credit, \cWildCard{\they} \cWildCard{\have} not asked you outright, but you stole a glance at some of \cWildCard{their} notes, and you can tell \cWildCard{\theyare} interested. While you would never reveal this information if you thought anyone would try to repeat the ritual that led to the deaths of all those in your Temple, \cWildCard{} is the person you trust most in this new world. Unfortunately, your memories of the ritual itself are scattered at best, and you cannot remember exactly how to make the shift to be corporeal on the Divine plane. You aren't sure if the memory was locked away deliberately by \cDisneyMentor{} after they put you to sleep, or if it just got lost in the 200 years you slept. You haven't told \cWildCard{} that you can't remember; after all, \cWildCard{\they} \cWildCard{\have}n't actually asked you yet, and you are scared to disappoint \cWildCard{\them}. No, it's better to keep trying to find a way to remember the information! Even if you can remember it, though, you still have deep misgivings about sharing it, even with \cWildCard{}; there is always the small chance \cWildCard{\they} would misuse it and get people killed in the process. For now, though, it is a moot point---you've tried and tried to remember, but have come up empty. You are so frustrated you vent about it to your friend \cTechStar{} all the time. If only \cTechStar{\they} got along better with \cWildCard{}!

Speaking of \cTechStar{}, you recently overheard someone talking about  \cTechStar{\them} on the other side of a closed door. On your way out from stealing the papers from \cBunker{}, you passed by the advisor's lounge, to which the door was closed. That was unusual enough that you stopped for a moment to contemplate. Then you heard someone muttering to themselves. Now, you don't normally like to snoop without good reason (but you are quite good at snooping when you need to), but hearing \cTechStar{}'s name seemed like a good enough reason to get close to the door and listen in. The mutterings were indistinct, but you're certain you heard them say something about either getting control of \cTechStar{\their} creation, the VidCom technology, or preventing it from getting out---no matter the cost. The voice sounded serious. Deadly serious. Just what has \cTechStar{\they} gotten \cTechStar{\their}self into? Like yourself, \cTechStar{\they} \cTechStar{\are} an idealist, and genuinely wants to help others with \cTechStar{\their} technology---so whoever the voice belongs to is definitely a bad person.

Another notable event happening this weekend is that the current Principal, \cPrincipal{\full}, is choosing \cPrincipal{\their} successor. \cMusic{\full}, your favorite teacher, is vying for the position with \cBeetle{\full}. You think \cMusic{} would be a great principal and you hope \cMusic{\they} win\cMusic{\plural}!

There are mysteries to unravel, and friends to help, as well as helping to prepare the all important Ritual to direct the Storm, the main event of the weekend.  As a budding \cDisney{\cleric}, you are thrilled to be included in this vital work, and despite the many other priorities on your plate, you feel this is the most vitally important of all. Your contribution and subsequent vote will help, or harm, more people than you ever dreamed possible, and helping others is at the very core of your being. This is the most important weekend of your new modern life, and you can just feel that it is going to work out perfectly. You'll make sure of it!

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Ensure that the Ritual to Control the Storm goes flawlessly.
	\item Recover your memories of the ritual to become corporeal on the Divine plane. Then decide if you are going to tell \cWildCard{} or not. Maybe \cTechStar{} can help?
	\item Keep your baby Dragon a secret, take care of it with \cPirateChild{}'s and \cAdopted{}'s help, and give it the perfect name.
	\item Work with \cJuniorStatesman{} to discover what happened to the Avatars of \cFarmGod{}, the missing Giant Hummingbirds.
	\item Pass off the papers you stole from \cBunker{}'s briefcase to \cWildCard{}. Don't let \cWildCard{\them} cut you out of whatever \cWildCard{\they} find\cWildCard{\plural} out, though! If you're going to take risks for \cWildCard{\them}, you want to get part of the payoff.
	\item Protect your friend \cTechStar{}---someone plotting to steal or suppress \cTechStar{\their} VidCom technology, and \cTechStar{} might get hurt in the process.
	\item Steal at least one voting stone from another student, just for the fun of it!
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are a first year student.
	\item You have the \iLocket{} which shines with the light of \cFarmGod{} when opened. It is a religious artifact as powerful as any of the known Relics.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
		\contact{\cTechStar{}} A good friend and classmate from the \pTech{}. An idealist who wants to help the world.
	\contact{\cWildCard{}} Your rescuer, benefactor, and friend, who saved you from two hundred years of enchanted sleep.
	\contact{\cPirateChild{}} Your good friend and classmate from the \pShip{} who gifted you with a Dragon egg. Maybe not the brightest, but very enthusiastic…
	\contact{\cAdopted{}} Your good friend and classmate from the \pFarm{}, who kindly cast an illusion to conceal the Dragon egg \cPirateChild{} gave you. You feel a sense of kinship to \cAdopted{\them}, even though your temperaments are so different. \cAdopted{} was adopted into a noble family at a young age, and is deeply resentful about it. You don't understand why---you'd have given anything to be adopted into a family that loved you. Gradah was kind, and the monastery was home, but it wasn't a loving family like Oriole and so many of your other new friends have.
	\contact{\cMusic{}} Your favorite teacher, and you're excited that \cMusic{\they} \cMusic{\have} a chance at becoming the next Principal! You'll be rooting for them! 
	\contact{\cJuniorStatesman{}} A \pShip{} diplomat who is helping you find the missing avatars of Luminary.
