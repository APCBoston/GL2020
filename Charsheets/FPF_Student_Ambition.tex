%%Matt Fisher AKA Matt AKA FPF Student Ambition

You are \cAmbition{} (\cAmbition{\they}/\cAmbition{\them}), and 20 years old. It’s your second year at \pSchool{}, so you’ve had ample opportunity to learn the ropes and what strings you need to pull to come out on top. In your time at the \pSc{}, you’ve built connections that will determine your entire future, and one of them in particular could vault you to the very pinnacle of power and respect within your nation. You pride yourself on your ambition and drive, and you’re smart enough to play your cards right reliably. As a result, everything you could ever want is at your fingertips -- and through hard work and determination, you can have it all.

While others have had position, power, and connections handed to them, everything you have, you earned yourself through hard work and the Luck of the Gods. You have broken through barrier after barrier that should have capped how far you could go in life. No one you grew up with would ever have imagined that you would really make it to the \pSchool{}, coming as you did from a large family of moderate means. But you proved them wrong, and your family could not be more proud.  It has long been your ambition to achieve greatness for yourself so that you could give back to your loving parents and help support your younger siblings, and so far your future looks bright enough to ensure that much success. But as amazing as that is, you know you can go farther still -- because now, due to your diligent prayers, offerings, and personal dedication, you have been granted the chance of a lifetime.

Your friend \cHeir{}, the Heir of the elite Faledon family, has always felt trapped by the constraints of that destiny. At first you thought \cHeir{\they} \cHeir{\were} just a whining, spoiled child, despite being a year older than you. But as you got to know \cHeir{\them}, better you realized that the truth is quite different. \cHeir{} is smart enough to know that the power wielded by the Faledon family should not be handled lightly, or by one reluctant to the task. You were stunned, and incredibly honored when \cHeir{}, seriousness etched in every line of \cHeir{\their} face, asked you to take the position in \cHeir{\their} place. The Gods had favored you once again. \cHeir{} explained that if the two of you could get the right pieces in place, there was a ritual that would irrevocably cement you as Heir, freeing \cHeir{\them} to live life \cHeir{\their} way, and placing into your hands the power to lead the industry leading Faledon Tech and Manufacturing Company. Better still, the position comes with the Faledon’s seat on the government’s Council, meaning you would be a central part of your company’s government! As eager as \cHeir{} is to leave the job, your own eagerness to take it on and do it well is tenfold as strong.

In order to pull this off well, you know you need to take every opportunity to push yourself into the thick of politics, government, economics, and every other avenue of power. So with that in mind, there are a few other important opportunities you plan to make good use of. \cDiplomat{}, the famous diplomat who forged the current treaty between \pTech{} and \pFarm{}, will be present this weekend. While \cHeir{} is eager to avoid \cDiplomat{\them} due to their close ties with the Faledon family, you of course will want to curry favor with this influential person who will no doubt be reporting well or ill of you back to the Faledon family once your plan to become the Heir becomes apparent. Additionally, considering \cDiplomat{}’s presence, there’s bound to be international affairs of great importance occurring, possibly even a conclusion to the war.  You’ve just got to get in on whatever closed door meetings are occurring. Who knows -- perhaps, by the Luck of the Gods, you’ll be able to contribute in such a way that \cDiplomat{} will take note and be impressed by you. A favorable impression would certainly help smooth your way into the Faledon’s good graces, after the initial shock of your becoming Heir -- not to mention that the meetings themselves will also be invaluable experience.

There is of course also the matter of voting in the Ritual to control the Storm, which is the whole reason for this weekend’s events and guests. You’ve already volunteered to help with the preparations for the Ritual, as this is a prime opportunity to earn recognition and hopefully connections. Ideally you’d like to see the Mirror of Cassandra used. Influencing public opinion enough to control which Relic is chosen is an end in itself, as it would demonstrate publicly your own social and political prowess. But the use of the Mirror itself would symbolize the type of change you hope to bring in your own life and as Faledon Heir - not to mention that it’s traditionally considered Lucky. 

In terms of the Ritual itself, you hope to fight for the top spot, which would earn you extra power and prestige. To do this you’ll need to gain the favor of the teachers, who decide which students rank highest in voting authority. You’re the underdog here, but that never stopped you before.  Of course the matter of how you’ll vote, assuming you get the chance to meaningfully do so, remains to be seen. Perhaps that’s a piece of power you can bargain with to gain favor where you need it.

You’re also looking forward to the opportunity to participate in this year’s graduation demonstration, which \cMusic{} is organizing.  Happily, you don’t need to be graduating this year to participate. This demonstration presents a great opportunity for you - not only as a way to present your prodigious magical skill to the world, but also to demonstrate your ability to exert the influence needed to get selected. You are obviously the best choice for the job, so it’s just a matter of proving that to \cMusic{}. Perhaps you can get your good friend \cChupStudent{} to participate as well? \cChupStudent{} at first glance is not particularly intelligent -- but in reality,  \cChupStudent{\they} \cChupStudent{\are} much stronger and smarter than \cChupStudent{\they} let\cChupStudent{\plural} on. You don’t  understand this stance in the least -- what benefit does someone get by hiding their true competence and missing out on the opportunities that competence can bring? Perhaps getting \cChupStudent{\them} to show off a little is just what \cChupStudent{\they} need\cChupStudent{\plural} to break that bad habit.

Finally, as if this all were not enough on your plate, you’ve accepted an offer from \cEvil{}, a Noble from \pFarm{}, to compete for an internship with \cEvil{\them}. You accepted this offer before \cHeir{} came to you with \cHeir{\their} plan to make you Faledon Heir, and that could be a conflict -- unless you can find a way to do both. But if for some reason your plan with \cHeir{} falls through, this internship would be a spectacular backup plan. And, if you -could- do both, imagine the benefit a connection in \pFarm{} would bring to your eventual role as leader of the Faledon family’s business interests abroad. \cEvil{} is incredibly well connected, and on the rise both within \pFarm{} and abroad -- and there is even rumor of \cEvil{} having a connection with the Queen of the \pFarm{}. You aren’t sure what you’ll need to do to earn the position, but you certainly don’t intend to let this chance pass you by.

This weekend is set to be the deciding moment for the most crucial pieces in the puzzle that is your young life. It will take everything you’ve got, alongside the luck of the Gods themselves, to bring this all together. Make your offerings, get to work, and you can claim more than was ever in the cards for one such as yourself. As well you know, determination, luck, and connection are the three keys to power, and you have the skills to command them all in this most crucial moment in time.

	\contact{\cHeir{}} is the Faledon Heir, and your friend, with whom you have a plan to trade fates, so to speak.
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} is a friend and confidante who adopts a perplexing facade of weakness and stupidity. It’s probably time to break \cChupStudent{\them} out of that shell.

	\contact{\cEvil{}} is a powerful Noble from \pFarm{} who you don’t know much about - but you do know that \cEvil{\they} \cEvil{\have} offered you a golden chance to compete for an internship.
