Form of government
The Chupacabra religion is a cult of personality, surrounding /cCultLeader. While young, they have incredible charisma, mostly natural, but due in some part to magical enhancements of their own devising. As a citizen of the Viking nations, /cCultLeader carefully selected bishops as their generals in other nations with enough charisma combined with blind obedience to start their own sects. The highest ranking bishops are named /cTechBishop and /cFarmBishop, one who is in LARP and one who is not.
School attendees
The Chupacabrists do not have official representation at the school. However, they have pulled a lot of strings and taken many risks to sneak a few of their highest ranking supporters into the ranks of those attending this conference. /cCultLeader is masquerading as the sibling of one of the Vikings who secretly have amnesia. /cTechBishop is an official in the government sent here to “inspect the goings on of the school”. Various other attendees were also snuck in.
The Chupacabrists are keen to take this chance to induct some new members, particularly the naive children who control the vote.
Economy
The Chupacabrists don’t have an economy, per-se, but recently they have started to administer a fast growing black market using the connections already put in place to transfer goods and services clandestinely throughout the three nations. They maintain a veneer of respectability to the rank and file by claiming these are all for religious use, but in actuality, are smuggling large amounts of dangerous contraband - all for the greater good, of course. There are rumors among the normal members of the cult, but so far no concrete evidence has escaped the smuggling arm of the sect.
Politics/International relations
The Chupacabrists have maintained a low profile throughout their lifespan, but avoiding the notice of governments entirely was impossible. Their profile is highest in the Viking nation, and even average citizens are aware of them there. Many Vikings are sympathetic to the Chupacabra message, even if they don’t believe - their message of fairness and equality between nations strikes a chord with many. However, if the full extent of their goals were revealed, they would become far less popular, so only the most trusted hear about their ambitions to destroy magic.
The Technocrats and the Agrarians think of the Chupacabrists as terrorists, and indeed, the branches within those nations are more adversarial to them. But neither nation has truly recognized the threat that the Chupacabrists pose as of yet.
The strip of land of the Technocratic society closest to the vikings have great empathy for the Vikings, and are also more susceptible. 
Religious or moral principles
Consequences - see Cultural Taboos/social norms
Do people
Personal and political equality - wants to destroy magic for the sake of true equality.
Unusual biological features (if any)
None - this faction is made up of people from other factions, and has no discernible outwards difference.
Brief History of the country
The Chupacabrist movement started in earnest the first time the Viking civilization was wrongfully hit by the storm, 6 years ago. Their leader, /cCultLeader, had been moving and planning before then, but seized the opportunity and ran with it when the storm hit. It didn’t take long to instill their values with a few friends on an exchange trip, and turn them into the founding members of the fast growing movement. Since then, the cult has been developing in secret and growing in power.
Educational system
The Chupacabrists follow the standard cult playbook - ease the new recruit in with friendship and relatable worries and concerns, then slowly step up the radical thinking until it reaches the level of brainwashing. Religious services are intense and draining, and priests of the religion are highly prized for their ability to recruit quickly and effectively.
Technology
The technology of the Chupacabrists is cobbled together from the technologies of the other nations, which in practice means that it mostly resembles that of the technocrats. However, the Chupacabrist leadership have developed several means of magically enhancing charisma not available to the general public, which they use to great effect.
Geography
The Chupacabrists meet in plain sight, often masquerading as other types of gatherings.
Cultural foods
None
Sexuality and Relationships
The Chupacabrists are very socially liberal, and embrace all forms of LGBTQ+ relationships. They are even encouraged as a means of recruitment.
Cultural taboos / social norms
Speaking against the cult is frowned upon, but in general the Chupacabrists strive to be very open about taboos. Murder is still a taboo, but the punishment is different - rather than losing your own memory, the people around you lose their memory of you. 
This has a dangerous side effect - instead of crippling the person, it makes them harder to track - which is useful for Assassins. They live a lonely life in service of their religion, but an effective one. Coworkers keep their distance from each other so that they can continue to remember each other and work together. Assassins have a life-span, however - if you kill too much, and no one remembers you, eventually the world forgets you as well, and you fade out of existence. You are trapped and unable to interact with the world, stuck as a ghost. These assassins are BELIEVED to be joining their god, but are just trapped in limbo.
Costuming Related Items
Chupacabrists strive to maintain secrecy, and so masquerade as their nation of origin. However, they do keep a small pin on their person at all times to show their allegiance - these can be provided in game.
Magic
The Chupacabrist leadership have developed several means of magically enhancing charisma not available to the general public, which they use to great effect. Magic from the three nations has also have begun to spread between different sections of the movement, and is being used to surprise leadership of the different countries.

Meeting notes 8/24
Soften how we think of how the fall of magic will affect everyone. The followers of genesis have to realistically think that it’s not that bad, especially for them.

The Chupacabrists are all about sacrifice. They think about ending magic as sacrificing the old work to get a better one.

Notes prior to 8/24
Chubacabraists - More liberal (out of rebellion against poverty). More likely to be young, except for the students of the school, as they are hand picked

Rise of Chubacabra religion is causing storms to be even stronger than should be, increasing amplitude - make the storm bad enough and stay at the school and it will destroy the conduit.  Only way to fix magic is with magic (like how Vikings were thinking of it)

Chupacabra want storm to go to school and to destroy religion
Magic is destroyed
School is destroyed
Agrarian famine - Technomancers also starve
Vikings unable to battle sea serpents
Technomancers - Unable to use magic for mining / trade / etc.  All technology stops working

Apocalyptic

Character idea - charismatic leader

Plot ideas - convert members to their group

Character ideas - prominent moles

Chupacabrists started with Vikings
Chubacabra - why don’t all of them jump on
Has to be more than traditionalist
Family that is in charge because have lots of magic is invested in magic not going away
Perhaps one of them has theory that ships go faster because magic - will go do research to prove it
A Viking kid who wants to go to school might run to go to school to prove / disprove thesis
Vikings initially sympathetic to Chubacabras but then backpedal
more likely to be part of Chubacabra religion because seen as option in part of restoring the balance.  Not endorsed by Vikings, just growing more easily there because of terrible conditions there

Chupacabra wild card
Steal / transfer / neutralize power of the children
Killing people?  Could have a handler
Creating potion of the river Lethe
Possibility that Chupacabra has different punishment to murder that isn’t wiping people’s memories
Could start game with a dead NPC - looking for murderer with missing memory but the murderer isn’t missing memory
Potentially have amnesiac character who is being framed for this
Does the Chupacabra God punish murder, what do they punish, and how do they punish?
Perhaps start to cease to exist in other people’s memory (ie: someone they care about back home forgets who they are) - being removed from reality.  Once person has nobody who remembers you, you cease to exist / fall off face of the planet and go to the realm of the Gods.
Belief makes power for Gods, removing belief in person who is being punished
No murder until X, etc
No weapons here, have to make poison going to use, etc etc
