National History:		9 years ago formed alliance with Agrarians.  Agrarians give Free People a better deal on food, and vote storms to Vikings, in exchange Free People will invent way to permanently stop storms, while maintaining magic.  This is now known to be impossible, and we don't want the Agrarians to find out.  We are getting desperate and trying more and more risky methods to try to create a way to make this deal work and cover our lie.  We've been working so hard on inventing a solution that we aren't properly fortified so if a storm hits us it would be a disaster.
	Storms:		T-6 should have been ours, hit vikings.  Kids who did this vote seen as heroes.  older siblings?  Teachers suspect was not accident.
