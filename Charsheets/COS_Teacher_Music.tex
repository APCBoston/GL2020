%% Dana AKA COS Teacher Music

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves.

You are \cMusic{} (\cMusic{\they}\textbackslash\cMusic{\them}), and you are 52 years old. You are from \pFarm{}, and work as a teacher at the \pSchool{}. You are a devout follower of \cFarmGod{} and your spirituality is an important part of who you are. You are caring, approachable, and devoted to the well being of all in your care. The balance of the world was broken 6 years ago, and you are in a position to help fix it now - so that's just what you intend to do.

%%Calm, kind, helpful, warm, approachable. Firm/strict on personal boundaries. Sometimes butting in to other people's business with the best of intentions.

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

Your early life was easy, since your family is old, landed nobility. You had the best education possible, including several focus programs. In one about the relgions of \pEarth{}, you were assigned a pen pal in \pTech{}. \cBeetle{} and you were a surprisingly good match, and you maintained your correspondence long after the program ended. 

You have always loved music - it was the first thing that drew you to the church. You spent several years studying music and preparing to enter the priesthood, encouraged by your family for the status boost it would have provided. Your family was initially disappointed when you realized that your true calling lay in teaching, but ultimately appeased when you landed a position as the music teacher at the \pSchool{} 18 years ago. You never married, but you consider every student who passes through the school to be one of your children.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the character's current life, problems, and priorities. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life. Current life and situation.   What they think about the most important contacts.

After 12 years at the \pSchool{}, you were feeling pretty comfortable in your life. But then everything seemed to go wrong at once. Twelve students were killed, the treaty of decades was broken, the \pLeau{} were betrayed, and a war started soon after. You were shaken to your core and realized it was time to take a more active role in the world around you.	Shaping young minds were not enough if those young minds were then slaughtered. 

Knows that Yvonne was adopted; keeps trying to reach out to her and connect.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.
