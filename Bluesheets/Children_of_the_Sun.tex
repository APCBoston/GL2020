\textbf{Form of government:}

\textbf{Names of major players:}

Queen 
Is there a King in the picture?  I like the idea of matriarchal rule, but do we want a mostly patriarchal society that happens to have a Queen as main ruler right now?  Patriarchy fits in well with the feudal system...
Nobility
Councillors, wealthier Lords / Ladies, land owners
Overlords
Still own land, but not as wealthy / don’t have the same influence as main Nobility
Still have magic - to tend the fields / ensure crops will grow well
Lesser nobility
Benevolent dictatorship w/ Feudal system - just because you love Queen Victoria, you may not love your overlord.  Only the overlords have land, but nobody else does - they just work the land and don’t take much home at the end of the day because bills (rent, etc)
People who are frustrated are likely to break the law or break the religion
Benevolent dictator is ensuring that overlords do their job every spring, maintain decent conditions for serfs, etc, X amount of people per farm lands
Some lords may be decent, some horrific, some wonderful - dependent on individuals
Could cause resentment with people at the bottom - causing low socioeconomic to turn to goat worship

\textbf{School attendees:}
Kids
Mainly the children of the Queen / the nobility
Occasionally children who have been sponsored by the nobility who are found to have magic
Representatives

\textbf{Economy:}

\textbf{Trade:}

\textbf{Major industries:}

\textbf{Politics/International relations:}

Relations with the other nations
Agrarian and Mageocracy have had an unprecedented period of growth / etc since weren’t hit by storm in many years, maybe weren’t fortifying properly because of this alliance and so would be extra hurt if storms hit them because were depending on the alliance to keep them safe
How do they interact with the small Viking settlements / fortifications built alongside the Agrarian lands to protect them?  Perhaps people living next to the coast / the Viking settlements typically get on better / have better viewpoint of Vikings and in general are against the Vikings being ganged up on.  But perhaps also is mainly lesser nobility (less fertile land generally or just more dangerous) and didn’t have the influence at court to sway people and convince people that the Viking alliance was important and shouldn’t just gang up on them.  
Vikings - threatening to stop protecting from sea serpents / dragons unless appeased - would be especially frightening to those along the border
What did that fallout look like for the set of kids that were convinced to vote that way
Technocracy - heros
Vikings - stuck, couldn’t do anything
One of vikings murdered, removing vote
People who did that betrayal are the older siblings or cousins of current batch of children?
Need a character who is driving this investigation
Teachers / advisors would have been there - what if half of the faculty didn’t believe it was an accident but someone who is new now is going to have information that allows them to put that together
Agrarian - ?
Mageocracy promising end to the storms + keeping magic 
Trades with Technocracy

How does it impact your nation
How does it work differently in your nation
DO YOU EAT PAPER???
What does magic look like - generally people in power
If kid has incredible abilities and in very good standing with overlord, overlord may sponsor them to go to the school
ANGST - the kid at a very young age is spotted with incredible magic talent, lord adopts kid into household (caretaker / benefactor), parents (lowly farmworkers) parcel of land sold to neighboring lord so no further ability for child to contact birth parents but child taken away between 4 - 6 years so remember being poor farming child with 16 other children and not enough food to go around no privacy, but now in the lap of luxury and owe lord everything regardless of what things about morals.  
Illusion of power but not actual power, can’t actually lift up other farmworkers, etc
Farmworkers have very little magic, just do manual labor
Overload comes down every spring to push magic under the earth to make the seeds sprout, wife heals the workers
Ability for very obvious visual - kid planted the seed in a pot and poked the soil and it sprouted, or someone injured in farming accident and lays on hands
Seeds would sprout without overlord, but producing 2 - 3x as much as should be able to, stripping lands of their nutrients - make every plant be pest free, every seed sprout, every fruit great, etc etc.  Magic only thing allowing them to produce at scale that they’re doing
If didn’t have magic - mass starvation (land is worn out - dust bowl)  Also have outgrown capacity
Could demonstrate dust bowl effect - know of this farm where there was an uprising and overlord was killed and didn’t have magic and turned into a dust bowl within a year or two and no other overlords would take them because of the uprising
Consequences of no magic:
Can only feed x amount of people.  If you get rid of magic, you will kill x percent of your society.  Mass starvation if magic went away
Vikings - monsters stronger or use magic to fight them, without magic might not be able to - entire set of cultures might lose ability to be seafaring and portions of land might become more dangerous / unlivable due to dragon attacks
What did world originally look like?  What did three nations look like before magic?
Comfortably feeding own population growth + 80 - 90 percent of food to Technocracy plus some food to Vikings, who were they before they could produce all that?
Before fertilizers, had to actively fallow / let land rest / compost / etc - rebuild nutritional value of land.  If have 7 fields, 3 or 4 are fallow every year
As soon as magic goes away, all of land almost immediately inarable.  Famine the likes of what never seen before.  Population of what they are feeding - Agrarian and Mageocracy peoples
Mass starvation, population severely reduced

Timeline of the Storms:
Timeline of Storms
Storms - hit every 3 years
Is everyone there, everyone who is part of the school?  Or are there other students there?
More than the players, but they’re off on “Holiday” - getting sent home to spend time with family in case they get blown up by a storm that your classmates are going to be picking
NPCs that aren’t present that players may have close personal ties with
College - 3 year education
Non-royalty - must be smart enough, talented enough, have enough magic
Royalty - automatically get to go
Some people pay to go, some people get in based on connections
Some are voting as freshmen, some as older
Storm Hit These Locations starting with present year:
Present year - happening, don’t know where
T-3: Vikings
T-6: Vikings (was Technocracy’s turn)
T-9: Agrarian
T-12:Vikings
T-15:Technocracy
T-18: Agrarian
T-21: Vikings
T-24: Technocracy
T-27: Agrarian
T-30: Vikings
T-33: Technocracy
Previous - random or whatever politicking at the time, don’t know yet, or even same cycle but broken occasionally
 
\textbf{Economy:}

\textbf{Religion:}

Hummingbirds the size of cars
Messengers of the Gods
They are the oracles of the world
Oracles of the Agrarian society 
Communicate through song, have to interpret (may or may not be wrong)
Smaller hummingbirds also useful and revered - not all of them are the same size



Immigration
If culture with amazing theatre / art program, could have people wanting to move there
Ie: someone going to technocracy because they want to become an artist / be in a theatre program
Policies
Viking - 6 months on our ships, if can’t hack it then we dump you wherever we are and you go your own way
Technocracy - hold auditions - must either be talented artist or talented inventor.  Engineer / mage / artist
Agrarian - will take anybody but unless they have something great to offer, they will be a serf.  Living a life of serfdom may be better than technocracist prison
Maybe other two cultures are not as welcoming of the arts
More hard work, day in day out diligence leads to success
Technocracy offers promise of fame and fortune if you are great but will have a poverty class like you have never seen, but people who are impoverished may refuse to admit / acknowledge that they are.  Hollywood / Broadway culture.  Include some musical parody’s (Wicker, etc)
Music
Music is sacred, not appropriate for people to do
Go see technocracy 
Must be priest to be a musician - more stifling
Priest character who wants to do rock music but can’t
If want to do own music instead of priesthood music to run away from home and do an audition
And if you fail, there are consequences
High life cost to immigrating
Crimes / Punishment
Crimes punished by the Gods
Murder - punished the same way, but other crimes are punished differently by the Gods
How does immigration play into that
Belief based / consent based religion
Person grew up in farming society, wants to move to technocracy, in order to do that and avoid the wrath of the god of farming, they have to be accepted by God of the mageocracy
Conversion must involve consent on both sides
Part of immigration act is a conversion priest who guides you on the path from one to the other
Don’t need consent of the god you’re leaving, just the consent of the god you’re following
Atheists?
Culture of indoctrination on each nation
Parents will indoctrinate you and when older, can be adopted into another religion
Advantage of joining a religion - all of them apply
Hardest - have three sets of rules to apply (Chubacabra religion is kind of weird, etc) - or maybe it does apply and that’s how they realize there’s suddenly a 4th God
How involved are the Gods?
Maybe normally just accept you, but certain things make it more complicated
Nobody likes murder, but what about theft (Viking God), then someone who has done that previously even if not part of that god’s purview, that God may not be willing to take them in and priest will not be able to sucessfully transition
If you remove your original God and your new God won’t take you, think better be a Chubacabraist
Abusive to animals / run a fighting ring / starve your pets - Agrarian God hates you
Technocracy God
Values self expression / hope / music / art
Book burning - removal of information from the world?  Removal of information from the world - could necessitate a secret bunker of information to ensure that information is not kept
Actively hold people back from their potential
Magic using overlord who keeps serfs and keeps them down (builds success off backs of other people) - bad
Serf who want to play music - good
Chubacabra - Anything that would prevent the chubacabra God from taking people in?  Generally a lot more inclusive and less picky
Looking to steal power - in order to do that, need to steal people
Bring me everybody because I want things?
What does the God actually want?
Power that other gods have - not enough to provide unless God steals it
Someone who is upholding and reinforcing the setup of another God - may be more difficult to convince the acceptance (potential for spies)
Priest - starts out as priest of technocracy and actively works to uphold / increase the technocracist religion - not acceptable
Priest - subverts their religion / not a good priest essentially - acceptable
Gods maybe aren’t always looking into your head, but they do during conversion - but also isn’t looking all the time (usually not) so once you pass selection and are in, then they might not complain
Goal generally to remain unnoticed
Priest who converts through secrecy?  (Magic to change memories / feelings)
How fallible do we want the Gods to be?
Like Tortall Gods - most fallible to other Gods
Not necessarily another person who is doing the magic, but another God
Just lying in bed all “la de da, want a normal life” and the God is like, “hey girl, you’re going on a quest”
CHARACTER - someone is here on a quest they did not sign up for
How do they send people on a quest
People are used to hummingbirds the size of cards being the ones sending the prophecies, but then just hanging out in the garden and a tiny hummingbird comes and says “hey, quest” but in song
Small ones are the ones who are divine?
Jeremy would like to see a hummingbird “cool-aid man” through a window - can we make this happen? :D
Beetles
Generally hard to interpret, but if they want you to go on a quest, it’s very legible
Quest - legible for people who the message is for, difficult for all others
Prophecy
Different Gods have different things to say about the future / the cliff
Chubacabra says FULL SPEED AHEAD!!!


Sun’s Children
Double down on “gay penguin couples take over eggs”
Adults are getting hurt on the farm too - group / pair of adults who can take on people in community
Children are seen as communal aspect - can be with whoever you want to be but cannot socially choose to be childless, even if old - if 30 and choose not to raise children, people are looking askance at you
Poly relationships are normalized
Folks who are nonbinary / genderqueer / etc - people who are queer make the best children, because look after all of the children, because if you have your own you don’t have time for all of the chilren
Educators / etc
