\name{\cPresident{}}

You are \cPresident{} (\cPresident{\they}/\cPresident{\them}), and a student at \pSchool{}. You are 22 years old, the Student Body President, and it is your (self appointed) job to keep your fellow students safe when the adults won't. You are from \pShip{}, and primarily follow the teachings of \cEbb{\full}. Ebb's focus on selective pruning of things dead or no longer needed, providing answers and closure, and paving the way for new things, drives you.

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

You were born in the 2nd fleet, and grew up with \cInitiate{}, your best friend. The two of you did everything together, except go to academy. You went to 2nd fleet academy, which focused on politics, negotiation, and economic management; \cInitiate{\they} went to 1st fleet academy to study religion. You hoped to follow in your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}'s footsteps and become a politician. The war breaking out in your 5th year of schooling only served to emphasize the need for diplomatic solutions that never-the-less centered justice and reparations for past wrongs. At \pSchool{}, your earlier schooling served you well, and you are now the student body president. Reunited with your best friend, \cInitiate{} the two of you are more or less unstoppable. Or would be if \cInitiate{\their} luck would stop being utterly rotten for 10 seconds\ldots what's with that anyway?

You are committed to finding out what happened at the \pSc{} six years ago - just before the war started. You know there was treachery, there must have been. How could the students from \pShip{} have voted to send the storm there out of turn? They would have known that it disrupted the balance. And while the Gods see to the punishment of murderers, it is up to the people to see justice is brought upon those who enabled it. It is up to you and a few others you have convinced of the urgency of finding answers: \cLibAssist{}, and \cHeir{}. You haven't been able to uncover the truth before now because something was missing, you need \iMirror{}, which is arriving this weekend in the possession of \cDiplomat{} - now you just have to hope \cDiplomat{\they} will part with it.

Uncovering the past isn't the only thing on your mind. You've also got to look to the future. For the good of your country, the student body in general, and for your friends among them, there are a couple of things happening this weekend you can't just leave the grown ups in charge of. For the preservation of the school, it is important that the ley lines be renewed every three years. As student body president, you may be called up on to assist. As this is your last year at the \pSc{}, you will be expected to participate in the graduation ceremony. And lastly, the most hands on task: The ritual to control the storm. After the voting, a ritual is enacted to channel the magic from the students into actually directing the storm. The ritual requires the use of one relic per nation. Per protocol, for the \pShip{}, the \iNet{} must be used. The \iChalice{} was used 3 years ago, and it is necessary for balance that they alternate. Further, the \iNet{} was involved in the ritual 6 years ago. It is fitting that it be used in the ritual the year you are going to set everything to rights.

You anticipate that setting up the ritual will be the most challenging. Aside from the usual politicking over which relics to use (which you have been warned to expect), the Librarian, \cLibrarian{} has been acting\ldots odd. \cLibrarian{\They} Maybe more than odd. It's like \cLibrarian{\they} can't remember how to do \cLibrarian{\their} job. Like \cLibrarian{\they} can't remember anything. Normally publicly accusing someone of murder is a faux-pas; people generally consider amnesia to be sufficient punishment, but sometimes it is necessary - especially if you can't figure out who they killed. \cLibrarian{} is supposed to be the most knowledgeable person at the school about the ritual, but if \cLibrarian{\they} really \cLibrarian{\have} lost \cLibrarian{\their} memories, you may be called upon as an expert.

In and among all of the responsibilities as Student Body President, time has rather gotten away from you on the social front. You kept meaning to approach \cHeir{} or \cChupStudent{} romantically, but never quite got around to it. And now might be your last chance - a rush job might be kind of awkward, but \cInitiate{} makes a great wing\cInitiate{\person}. Despite not having any current partners, you identify as polyamorous. Could you possibly be lucky enough that both \cHeir{} and \cChupStudent{} might be interested in you, and willing to try polyam? Why did you leave this to the last minute? But could you really go the rest of your life not knowing what might have been?

You were really looking forward to getting your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}'s advice on the matter - the two of you were close before you went away to academy, and \cHeadDiplomat{\they} never steered you wrong. But now \cEbbPriest{} says that \cHeadDiplomat{} won't be coming? What happened to \cHeadDiplomat{\them}? You must find out!

So, this is your last weekend at \pSchool{}. You've got a lot riding on it, both personally and professionally you suppose. Still, you and \cInitiate{} are up for the challenge.


\begin{itemz}[Goals]

	\item Find out what happened to your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}, \cHeadDiplomat{}. Maybe \cEbbPriest{} knows something?
