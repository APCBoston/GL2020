\section*{What is the \pSchool{}?}

The \pSchool{} is the literal and metaphorical center of \pEarth{}. It resides at the center of the continent, adjoined by all three nations. The school itself is set on a tiny airborne island suspended in the sky by the twining ley lines of the world; in fact, every major ley line in \pEarth{} connects at this spot. It is accessible only by vehicles reinforced against the elements, which are lifted by thick cables.

The island sits above a placid lake. Like the island above it, it is not a particularly large lake, but it does have many unusual properties due to the ley lines that converge upon it. Unlike most other bodies of water in \pEarth{}, no fish, bird, or sea serpent has ever been recorded to reside in this lake, making travel to and from the school relatively safe in normal times.

The island was chosen as the location of the \pSc{} because the Gods demanded it be constructed here. No one knows why the Gods chose this location, but once the Storms started to come a century after its construction, the prevailing theory became that the confluence of leylines makes this the ideal location for the Ritual.

The \pSc{} itself is part academy, part library, part archive, and part Temple to the Gods. The brightest, best connected, and most magically powerful from all three nations are sent to the \pSchool{} to finish their studies -- and the best of those remain there during the Time of Deciding to participate in the Ritual to Control the Storm.

The current Principal of the \pSc{} is named \cPrincipal{}. Like every Principal before \cPrincipal{\them}, \cPrincipal{} has been granted immortality by the Gods both as a reward and as a way to ensure the \pSc{} is under a steady and stable hand. 

The \pSc{} maintains its independence from all three nations, and is in fact the only truly independent place on the continent. It maintains this balance with careful political maneuvering, financial strength, powerful magical defenses, and protection from the Gods themselves. The \pSc{} is funded partially by the three nations, even in this time of war, but it supplements its funding with high tuition and donations from wealthy alumni.

\section*{Campus}

Even centuries after its construction, the \pSc{} is a wonder of magical construction. Each of the main buildings surpass the largest buildings on the continent, made of giant, unbroken slabs of granite, with Gothic pillars supporting wide roofs with painstakingly sculpted eaves. The buildings sport the continent’s first stained glass windows with fanciful depictions of figures of legend and the very Gods that ordered its construction. 

The Library is a particularly impressive building, sporting bookshelves that span multiple stories, accessible by small catwalks. A massive spiral staircase winds down into the very heart of the island, offering access to deeper, and more dangerous, levels for those who dare. This building is heavily magically warded and contains many of the most dangerous, forbidden, and ancient knowledge on the continent. It is not always clear whether the wards are meant to protect things in the library from outsiders, or to protect outsiders from the things in the library. The dangers of navigating the Library are great enough that specially trained Librarians need to pass down the knowledge of how to survive its maintenance and access its deepest secrets. It is said that the Gods themselves maintain the magical protections in the Library.

Other facilities are just as impressive. The rooms in the student dormitories and staff housing are lavish, large, and well-maintained. There is ample space for the current class of 181 enrolled students (20 per nation per year) and the 100 strong faculty and support staff, though many choose to commute from nearby settlements regardless. The cafeteria is world-class, and aims to please even the palates of enrolled or visiting nobility. Even the groundskeeper’s homes are well appointed and the positions highly paid.

\section*{Curriculum}

The curriculum of the \pSc{} is the most advanced in \pEarth{}. Over the three years of a student’s tenure, they are given the best education in subjects ranging from Combat to Mathematics to Diplomacy. Students emerge from the \pSchool{} as well-rounded individuals, capable of and sought after for jobs in just about every discipline. 

The most basic qualification for the \pSc{} is high magical power, and that gift is honed to perfection alongside the minds of its young wielders. As magical power fades past approximately college age, it is no exaggeration to call the \pSchool{} the highest concentration of the magically powerful on \pEarth{}.

\section*{The Time of Deciding}

Ever since the Storms descended on \pEarth{}, the \pSc{} has been the site of the Ritual to control the Storm during the Time of Deciding. During this time, non-essential staff and students who are not chosen to participate are sent home for the holiday, the magical bunkers are opened to defend those that remain, and the transport gondolas are shut down until the Storm passes. You can read more details on the Time of Deciding in the \bWorld{}.
