%Do not set as any gender other than male%

You are \cPirate{\full} (\cPirate{\they}/\cPirate{\them}). You have taught Shop and Crafting at the \pSchool{} for 18 years, and everyone knows you as genial and approachable. While you started life as a pirate aboard the 8th fleet Silent Fog, nearly two decades on land have you questioning whether you actually want to go back. Either way, this weekend will be the culmination of many things you have long prepared for.

You grew up in 8th fleet, bouncing from ship to ship. 8th and 9th fleet struggle more than anywhere else in the \pShip{}, and youngsters are often sent on to the next ship when there isn’t enough food to go around. It’s not surprising, therefore, that many ships ultimately turn to piracy, preying on their fellow \pShippies{} as well as the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}. The Silent Fog is the best pirate ship there is, and you were lucky to end up aboard her at the end of your travels.

The Silent Fog was legendary for a reason -- and it was in no small part due to Her captain’s ability to play the long game. Long enough to forge paperwork and send you to work at the \pSchool{} to see what secrets you could learn. And you learned so much -- particularly about the relics that are used to control the Storm. The Storms devastate wherever they hit, but pirate ships, with no safe harbor to anchor in, are often battered to pieces among the jagged shoals of \pWod{}. One relic in particular, the \iNet{}, was of interest. When steeped in the high energy magic of the building storm, it can be used to directly control the tides and waves. With it, a ship could survive any Storm, no matter how bad, and would be nigh on uncatchable to boot. So you and the Captain hatched a plan to steal it.

As part of your cover, you made a point to get to know the other teachers, and the subset of Advisors who come to the school every three years. \cEthics{}, the Ethics teacher, took a surprising shine to you, and the two of you have been great friends almost since you first set foot on the Island. \cEthics{} is an incredibly intelligent \cEthics{\person}, and while you are very good at pretending, you are not entirely sure you have \cEthics{\them} fooled.

Still, you were quite surprised when \cEthics{\they} asked you a tremendous favor less than a year after you arrived. \cEthics{} had agreed to help an anonymous parent get an innocent child to safety in \pShip{}. You’ve always had a soft spot for children -- and while you knew life on the Silent Fog wouldn’t exactly be easy, you could think of no better place to conceal a child. So you did.

On the advisor side, you’ve found a friend in \cBunker{}. \cBunker{} is an engineer who designed and installed the Bunkers that help protect the people at the school from the Storm as it builds in power. The two of you love to talk shop and trade tips and tricks on building things - even if \cBunker{\their} focus is on engineering and architecture, and yours is more on repair and crafting intermediate materials. Seeing as you are both \pShip{}, you have the most delightful conversations about how the littlest details can make or break a project. 

\cPrince{}, the \cPrince{\Heir} of \pFarm{}, started out as a friend -- but three years ago, that relationship blossomed into romance. It’s daunting to be romantically involved with a member of royalty, but you’ve been together long enough that that nervousness had mostly worn away. Unfortunately, \cPrince{\their} moderate dislike of pirates that most of \cPrince{\their} country shares has blossomed into a full blown hatred ever since \cPrince{\their} royal train was attacked and \cPrince{\they} \cPrince{\were} robbed. So it might get a little\ldots awkward\ldots once you get around to revealing your origins. Maybe you can talk \cPrince{\them} around? Maybe you can find the right moment to tell them the truth? Or maybe it’s enough to swear of pirating in the future? After all, it HAS been almost two decades since you were aboard the Silent Fog\ldots 

As for what you’d do if you weren’t being a pirate, well\ldots In your time at the \pSc{}, you’ve come to admire \cFlowPriest{}, and \cFlowPriest{\their} devotion to \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}. If only it were possible for you to become a \cPirate{\cleric} yourself. But only those who bear the mark of the Goddess are allowed to even try. The Goddess’ mark never appears past puberty. If it doesn’t appear, it never will. You still harbor some hope of finding a way to make the mark appear, to fake one, or to find precedent to let you try anyway. But some days it’s harder than others to hold onto the possibility. At those times, \cBunker{}, in whom you have confided this hope, persuades you to keep trying, even though \cBunker{\they} are not religious in the slightest - \cBunker{\they} support{\cBunker{\plural} your dream. And becoming a \cPirate{\cleric} really would be a convenient solution to \cPrince{}’s hate of pirates. Your relationship could continue, either long distance, or if by some miracle you convince \cPrince{} to renounce \cPrince{\their} claim on the throne and join you in the \pShip{}.

Becoming a \cPirate{\cleric} and renouncing piracy without fulfilling your initial mission would leave the Silent Fog high and dry though -- and though you may not necessarily stay, you are still loyal to your Captain. The Captain has sent someone here, this weekend, to help you retrieve the \iNet{}. They are to find you with the phrase ``The Waters untouched are not abandoned.‘’, and you are to respond with ``Those brave enough chart the course‘’ so they know you are true. Once you find each other, the two of you must prevent the \iNet{} from being used in the ritual, as this will expend it’s magic, and smuggle it off the island. It would be particularly hard to talk your way out of it if \cPrincipal{} found out. \cPrincipal{\They} take no pains to hide their intolerance against pirates.

Maintaining a cover this deep involves more than just making friends. You occasionally have to be seen making an effort above and beyond. In this case, you’ve settled on being picked to give the Teacher’s speech at the Graduation Ceremony. It’s a nice, flashy, public thing you can do to maintain your charade. And when you sat down to try to write something up, you found yourself surprisingly impassioned. You drew on the inequalities you grew up with, and now you very much want to point the graduating students at the socioeconomic inequalities in \pEarth{}. The plight of the pirates will never change if those in power cannot understand that they are driven to it by desperation and a lack of opportunity. Maybe your speech (if you can convince \cMusic{} to pick you) will convince these kids to eventually do something to change the socioeconomic imbalances. 

But that’s in the future -- what of every suffering in the meantime? \pShip{} needs a break from being battered by the storm. As a teacher, part of your responsibilities this weekend is to contribute to the selection process for which students get the most voting authority for where to send the Storm. You have been on the lookout for which student among the \pShippies{} has the strongest presence and will be able to convince students from other nations to join to vote to send the storm somewhere other than \pShip{}. You aren’t sure you’ve found the perfect choice, but your choice at the moment is \cWarlordDaughter{}, \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of the \pShip{} Warlord. You should keep an eye out for another candidate if you can find one, though -- while being related to the Warlord is a positive in the eyes of the \pShip{}, it certainly isn’t looked on favorably by the \pShip{}’s enemies.

This weekend will decide what your future looks like. Will you be going back to the Silent Fog? Will you succeed in becoming a priest of \cEbb{} or \cFlow{}? Will you and \cPrince{} still be an item when the dust settles? So many questions, and so little time  -- you’d better get down to answering them.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Find your pirate contact from the Silent Fog, help them get the properly attuned and powered up \iNet{} off the island without getting caught. Don’t let \iNet{} be used in the ritual!
	\item Decide which \pShip{} student is the most likely to be able to build the coalition necessary to ensure the storm is not sent to \pShip{}, then convince your fellow teachers to give that student the most voting authority. \cWarlordDaughter{} may or may not fit the bill.
	\item Figure out what to do about \cPrince{}. Is there any way to not have this relationship go down in flames?
	\item Decide if you still want to be a pirate, or if you want to try to become a \cPirate{\cleric}. If you do choose to try to become a \cPirate{\cleric}, you’ll have to find a way to get a real or fake Mark of the Goddesses to appear on your person.
	\item Convince \cMusic{} to pick you for the Teacher’s Graduation speech. Then give a speech that will inspire the new generation to address the socioeconomic inequalities in their countries.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You expect the pirate here to help you liberate the \iNet{} to approach you with the exact phrase ``the Waters untouched are not abandoned.’’ The proper, exact, response to indicate you are the person they are looking for is ``Those brave enough chart the course.’’ You will have to be careful though, as many people hate pirates. If the wrong person somehow knew the code phrases, or overheard you, it could blow everything.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cEthics{}} Your first friend at the school. You hit it off almost immediately. \cEthics{\They} entrusted you to hide a baby \cPirateChild{\child} among the \pShippies{}.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} A friend who supports your desire to become a \cPirate{\cleric}.
	\contact{\cPrincipal{}} The principal of the \pSchool{}. \cPrincipal{\They} \cPrincipal{\are} vehemently anti-pirate and if \cPirate{\they} found you out, getting fired would probably be the least of your worries.
	\contact{\cFlowPriest{}} A \cFlowPriest{\clergy} of \cFlow{} that you look up to greatly, and hope to emulate -- if only you can convince \cFlowPriest{\them} to give you the chance.
\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} A student you’ve had your eye on for a while as a potential organizer for the good of \pShip{} -- if \cWarlordDaughter{\their} lineage doesn’t poison the message. 
\end{contacts}
