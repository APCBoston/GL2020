\name{\cHedonist{}}

You are \cHedonist{} (\cHedonist{\they}/\cHedonist{\them}), and 51 years old. You are a \cHedonist{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{}, and perhaps indulge in the benefits of the position a little more than is strictly proper. Still, you do your duty, and try to do right by your country and the next generation. This weekend is going to be the hardest you’ve had to work since the last time you were here.

Your place in the Priesthood was assured from a very early age. Your family is quite powerful in the Priesthood (and consequently in the nobility), and your magical prowess manifested very young. This has made life quite easy for you, as you can sail through most challenges. For many things, your natural talent lets you complete most tasks with minimal effort -- and for anything more substantial, a bit of gold or a political favor greases almost any palm. You even dodged any real responsibility by getting your sibling promoted to the \cQueen{\Majesty}’s Court Cleric position instead of yourself.

The only emph{real} challenge you face is finding things to suit your refined palette. The best food comes from \pFarm{} of course, so that’s no problem -- but getting your hands on tech from the \pTech{} and art from the \pShip{} is harder, especially since the war started. Luckily for you, a black market has sprung up to serve the needs of people like you. It’s easy enough to trade a few minor curses and harmless state secrets in exchange for the latest synth clothing from the \pTech{}. Of course the \pFarm{} spymaster probably wouldn’t think them harmless secrets, but whoever they are, they haven’t caught you yet. 

Your most recent purchase was a particularly nice ring. It goes splendidly with your azure robes and sapphire chain. For your next purchase, you have your eye on a dry cleaning machine, which will allow you to safely clean the clothes without having to smuggle them back to the \pTech{} (after all, sending them openly would get them confiscated as soon as they crossed the border).

To be clear, it’s not that you are opposed to work -- just that you are opposed to \emph{unnecessary} work. And there is a lot of \textbf{necessary} work to be done this weekend. As a \cHedonist{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{}, you have responsibilities. These responsibilities are exacerbated by your colleague \cInterpol{}’s situation. \cInterpol{} is a \cInterpol{\cleric} for \cFarmGod{} too, but for some reason \cInterpol{\they} are hiding that fact. \cInterpol{\They} swore you to secrecy on the topic, a vow you take quite seriously -- but you didn’t swear not to ask about it yourself, and you’re dying of curiosity to know \emph{why}. In the meantime, though, you’ve got to cover the work of two Priests. Primarily this entails bringing the \iPitcher{}, one of the \pFarm{} relics for controlling the Storm, and ensuring the Relics are not tampered with. Secondly, it is your responsibility to look after the spiritual wellbeing of the followers of \cFarmGod{}. You are expected to provide council and guidance to students and advisors alike, and are charged with initiating anyone desiring to join the religion.

One of your unofficial duties is to keep an ear out for people asking about the Giant Hummingbirds. The Priesthood has known for some time that fewer and fewer of \cFarmGod{}’s Avatars have been appearing as of late. In the past six years, there have been a distressing \textbf{zero} verified sightings, and only 4 total in the previous decade. If the masses knew, it would incite a panic that \cFarmGod{} had forsaken the country, which is not something a country at war can afford. It would also signal a vulnerability that the \pShippies{} might try to capitalize on, or even your \pTechies{} allies. So far the Priesthood has had no luck determining the cause of the decrease, and your standing orders are to divert anyone attempting such a line of investigation.

Given your proclivity for technology and art, it is not surprising that your particular magical focus is unusually disparate from most magic in \pFarm{}. While you \emph{can} use music to channel magic and heal people, you aren’t a great composer of new work. Instead, your best work comes in tandem with magic users from other countries. \cBunker{}, an advisor from the \pShip{}, comes to the \pSchool{} every six years to examine and repair the magical bunkers. The two of you make quite a good pair, despite the various hangers on who are too busy gawking to tell a hammer from a wrench. You enjoy helping \cBunker{\them} and you think \cBunker{\they} enjoy the help in return.

The other focus of your work this weekend is far less mundane, albeit possibly less crucial? Curse the gods (quietly, of course) for making the things you must do less interesting than the things you want to do! Six years ago, the \pFarm{} allied themselves with the \pTech{}, and betrayed the \pShip{}. This was done because, by the previous treaty, the Storm should have been sent to \pTech{} -- but \pTech{} claimed to be on the verge of discovering a way to rid \pEarth{} of the Storm all together. Three years later, the same excuse was given. But now, the \pTech{} claims to have finally developed a solution. Head Scientist \cHeadScientist{} and assistant \cAssistantScientist{} are supposed to be presenting their findings this weekend. If it’s true, then your countries can come together and implement their solution, and finally be done with the whole thing. The sacrifice of the \pShip{} will have all been worth it. Then, you and the rest of the advisors can get around to talking them down from the ongoing war.

But you’ve been nearly swindled by knock offs of fancy things before -- and that makes you inherently suspicious of anything that comes at a price too good to be true. You have decided to launch your own investigation into the science that \cHeadScientist{} and \cAssistantScientist{} are working on. In pursuit of that, you have found a like mind in \cCurse{}, a cursemaker from the \pFarm{}. The two of you even have something of an informal competition going to see which of you can get to the truth first. Friendly competition aside, it’s worth thinking about what the consequences would be if it weren’t true. If the \pTech{} cannot end the storms, or ending the storms come with a cost too high to pay, then what? 

Whatever the answer ends up being, the Storms won’t be ending in time for at least this one last Storm. Therefore, you’ve got a responsibility as an advisor to help determine which students have the most votes to cast toward where to send it. Naturally, you wish to give the most influence to a student who thinks like you. As soon as you figure out what you should think, and how each of the students feel themselves, you can get right on that. Most of them should listen to you, since you are an advisor -- but if the other advisors start meddling, things could get a little more complicated. You may be able to wield your authority as a \cHedonist{\cleric}, but it’s no guarantee. And on Sunday morning, it will be your job to receive the will of the Gods and ensure that the voting stones are passed out to each of the 12 students appropriately. No one should be allowed to interfere with the process, lest you be blamed if something goes wrong.

The students here at the \pSc{}, particularly the twelve who stay this weekend to participate in controlling the Storm, bear a huge responsibility. And when they graduate, they will go on to be movers and shakers in their countries. The teachers shape these minds day in and day out. As an advisor, your one big chance to shape minds is the Advisor’s speech at the Graduation Ceremony. Teacher \cMusic{} is in charge of arranging the roster this year, and you intend to have \cMusic{\them} give you the task of giving the advisor’s speech. Naturally there will be competition for the honor, but you are prepared to compete -- and win.

As much stuff going on as it is, this weekend doesn’t need to be \emph{all} work. You have reason to believe the black market moves many goods through agents at the \pSc{}. If you can scope them out and play your cards right, you should be able to get that dry cleaning machine locked up. You should also keep your eyes out for anything else beautiful, useful, or simply interesting that you can acquire. After all, the black market is always full of surprises.

Another diversion will be catching up with your drinking buddy, \cWildCard{}. \cWildCard{} came to you as a client to buy some information during a day when you were somewhat drunk and feeling especially playful. \cWildCard{} ended up playing along with your shenanigans until your serious business meeting turned into a night of drinking -- and you’ve met up plenty of times to drink ever since. It turns out that \cWildCard{} will actually be here this weekend, too! You’d like to find a chance to catch up if you can.

People say that compromise is part of life -- but you’ve never found that to be the case. You’ve always been able to have your cake and eat it too. This weekend, that means indulging your desire for beautiful, fancy, and exquisite quality goods (regardless of the legality of their acquisition), alongside fulfilling your priestly and advisory duties. It might be a lot to do -- but you’ve always been able to handle challenges without breaking a sweat. Why should this weekend be any different?
