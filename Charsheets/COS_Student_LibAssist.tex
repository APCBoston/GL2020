\name{\cLibAssist{}}

You are \cLibAssist{\full;} (\cLibAssist{\they}/\cLibAssist{\them}). At 21 years old, you are a second year student at the \pSchool{}. You grew up in \pFarm{} as the only child of a barely noble family. Your family is unlanded, and is therefore pushed to the very margins of polite society---barely better than commoners. Still, your family gives you everything they can and you intend to pay them back by clawing your way to the top---by any means necessary.

From an early age you learned to calculate your every move for maximum benefit. Making friends was rarely advantageous, so you mostly went it alone. Even when all of your hard work paid off (okay, okay, and a lucky break) and you were selected for a spot at the \pSchool{}, you spent most of your first year in office hours and in the library, studying. You had to be the best student you could be. Yet you kept getting distracted by silly, frivolous things like the history of jewelry making. That wasn't going to be on the test, so why couldn't you keep it out of your head? Unfortunately, the \pSc{} has the best of the best of the entire continent, and any such distraction can be fatal to your prospects. You were in the process of struggling to keep your grades up when the Librarian, \cLibrarian{\full}, took you under \cLibrarian{\their} wing. At first, you told yourself it was just advantageous to you to buddy up to \cLibrarian{\them}---but time soon led to a real friendship forming instead. You and the Librarian spent many hours enjoyably researching the Relics stored in the library, The \iLariat{}, The \iNet{}, and The \iScythe{}.

When you came back for your second year, you expected to continue the way you had. You were not prepared for the fierce little ball of energy that was \cAdopted{\full}. \cAdopted{} is in \cAdopted{\their} first year at the \pSc{} and \cAdopted{\theyare} pleasantly similar to you in temperament. \cAdopted{} is also ambitious, although with somewhat different aspirations. The two of you became the best of friends and have hatched more than one Machiavellian plan together to get your way.

\cAdopted{} has been working on a particular scheme recently that you are excited to help with. \cAdopted{} is adopted, the \cAdopted{\child} of farmers, taken away to be raised by a noble family against \cAdopted{\their} will. \cAdopted{\They} \cAdopted{\have} been kept away from \cAdopted{\their} birth family all these years and \cAdopted{\they} resent\cAdopted{\plural} it deeply. The two of you have been working on a curse to put on \cAdopted{}'s dastardly family to teach them a lesson, and it should \emph{finally} be ready to cast this weekend. There are just a few final steps, and \cAdopted{} might need your help with them.

For purely political gains, you've done your best to cozy up to some of the older students, especially the ones from other nations. The activity sets your teeth on edge, but the investment may be finally paying off. \cPresident{\full}, the student body president, hangs out with you regularly and sometimes confides in you. While you're a little jealous and upset by how easily success seems to come for \cPresident{}, the prospect of making an important connection is of solemn importance to you. The two of you often study together in the library.

Speaking of the library, \cLibrarian{} has been acting really strange the last few weeks. Where \cLibrarian{\they} used to be open and welcoming, \cLibrarian{\theyare} suddenly distant and cagey. You've seen \cLibrarian{\them} wandering the stacks almost like \cLibrarian{\they} \cLibrarian{\were} lost. It surprised you how much it pains you to see your friend like this. You haven't worked out the best way to approach \cLibrarian{\them} about all this yet though, so you've just been silently covering for \cLibrarian{\them} whenever possible, particularly by helping people find things in the labyrinthian space of the library. 

As \pEarth{}'s foremost repository of magical items and tomes, it is a surprisingly dangerous place. In fact, the Librarian before \cLibrarian{} was killed on the job by a deteriorated piece of spellwork that backlashed unexpectedly when he tried to move it. You will have to figure out what's going on eventually. You don't like being kept in the dark, and you haven't quite mastered the depths of the Library yourself. That is not for lack of trying, of course---you sneak down into the lower, older, more dangerous levels at least once a week, even though you are not supposed to. You think you might be the only one who noticed that the \iScythe{} went missing from the Library a few weeks ago. Before you could work out how to tell \cLibrarian{} (since you shouldn't have been in that area of the Library alone), it mysteriously reappeared. You wonder what happened.

Knowledge is power. And while the library is full of knowledge, it's mostly \emph{old} knowledge. There is also current knowledge---useful, up to date information. The kind of information that flows as currency on the Black Market. Oh yes, you know about the Black Market that thrives under the very noses of every government on \pEarth{}. You were recruited by \cChupSecond{\full} originally, to serve as liaison to a surprising source---\cEthics{\full}, the Ethics teacher! You are unsure whether \cEthics{} and \cChupSecond{} know who is on the other end of the deals. You have a healthy dose of respect for \cChupSecond{}, and if you're being honest with yourself, a healthy dose of fear. \cChupSecond{\They} is scary, and could make your life very difficult if you told anyone that you know \cChupSecond{} has connections to the Black Market. \cChupSecond{\They} is always happy to have you facilitate a new sale, though. You've started to try your own hand at collecting and passing information as another means to claw your way up.

And one day, when your curiosity got the better of you, you opened one of the sealed packets you were carrying to read a message you are sure that neither \cEthics{} nor \cChupSecond{} knows. \cInterpol{\full}, the Combat teacher, is not actually a teacher at all. \cInterpol{\Their} entire history is fabricated! Put on the trail, you've spied on \cInterpol{} a bit, and are convinced \cInterpol{} is part of some kind of secret government agency. Can you use this to your advantage somehow? You won't know unless you confront \cInterpol{\them} with what you know.

Your clandestine activities go further still. One year ago, the History teacher, \cHistory{\full}, approached you with an intriguing proposal. Recognizing your keen mind, \cHistory{\they} recruited you to be \cHistory{\their} spy and informant among the student body, reporting any unusual or suspicious activity you came across. \cHistory{} is a high ranking noble in \pFarm{}, and has promised you that your services will be richly rewarded. While \cHistory{\they} hasn't come out and admitted it to you, you suspect that \cHistory{\theyare} involved in your nation's spy network. The most recent tidbit you shared with \cHistory{\them} is the mysterious disappearance and reappearance of the \iScythe{} from the library a few weeks ago.

If \cHistory{}'s promises fail to pan out, your options seem limited at first glance. You can't become a librarian, there's too little prestige in that---unless \cLibrarian{} dies, retires, or loses \cLibrarian{\their} job, in which case you could try to take \cLibrarian{\their} somewhat prestigious position at the \pSc{}. Winning the most votes to direct the Storm would be another way to gain prestige that you can cash in for social advancement later. One way to forward that is to very visibly assist in the preparations for the ritual to control the Storm, which will curry favor with the teachers. Or maybe you can amass enough information to blackmail someone important enough to get a serious job in the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s court? 

You might be thinking about the future, but even so, you've got one more year of school. And while you're here, it would certainly be nice to be at the top of the pecking order next year, i.e. voted student body president. Campaigns for that won't start for another few months, but among other things, being chosen to demonstrate your magical prowess as part of the Ceremony of Excellence will give you a boost toward that. You expect fierce competition from the \pTech{} students in particular, so you may need to get creative to ensure you stand out. You think you have a good shot at being chosen, especially if you can cozy up to \cMusic{\full}. Unfortunately, you don't think \cMusic{} likes you very much. You're not sure why. Maybe it has something to do with the way you encourage \cMusic{\their} adoptive grand\cAdopted{\nibling} \cAdopted{} to stand on \cAdopted{\their} own two feet and choose \cAdopted{\their} own path, without being beholden to the ``family'' who kidnapped \cAdopted{\them} in the first place?

This weekend is your big shot in a lot of ways, so you can't mess it up. You're going to do your family proud and get the respect and position you deserve. You aren't afraid to break the rules to do it either. A win is a win, after all---a quick and dirty one counts for just as many points as a clean and fair one. All that matters is that you and your friends come out on top!

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Continue to feed intelligence you come across to \cHistory{}, who has promised you social advancement in exchange. 
	\item Win the highest voting authority to direct the Storm; assisting the teachers with preparations for the ritual in service to this. Make sure that the Storm does not get directed at the Children of the Sun.
	\item Participate in the Ceremony of Excellence as one of the students doing the magical exhibition.
	\item Help \cAdopted{} get revenge on \cAdopted{\their} family.
	\item Figure out what is going on with \cLibrarian{}. Cover for \cLibrarian{} in the meantime by being an indispensable library aid.
\item Continue to play messenger for the black market, facilitating communication between \cEthics{} and \cChupSecond{} for as long as you find it beneficial to you personally to do so.
	\item See what concessions you can get from \cInterpol{} in exchange for your silence.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item Your extensive time in the library gives you major advantages over others when navigating the library.
