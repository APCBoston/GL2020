\name{\cChupSecond{}}

You are \cChupSecond{\full} (\cChupSecond{\they}/\cChupSecond{\them}), and the mastermind behind the growing success of the \pGoaties{}. Your fellow teachers think you are just a bit of a loner who teaches Economics at the \pSchool{}, but you are so much more - you are the epicenter of the black market on \pEarth{}, and soon-to-be leader of the \pGoaties{}.

Where \cChupLeader{\full}, the current leader of the group, is bombastic, you speak truthfully and realistically. Where \cChupLeader{} agitates for immediate action, you are patient and plan for the long game. Where \cChupLeader{} has \cChupLeader{\their} head in the clouds, you have your feet on the ground. \cChupLeader{} uses charisma magic to hoodwink people into joining the cause, you truly change hearts and minds.

You were very sick, for a very long time when you were small. Through that haze, you actually don't remember much of your life. You were always frail, and with little magic to call upon. This made employment hard to find, and you bounced from ship to port, barely scraping by. Your first truly vivid memory is nine years ago when \cChupLeader{} pulled you out of the bilges of the poorest boat in the 9th fleet, and spoke words to you that made you feel alive for the first time. Those words were the promise of a better life, for you and all of \pEarth{} -- a world of true equity and inclusion. \cGenesis{} was a very minor \cGenesis{\God} of luck at the time, but through \cChupLeader{}, you learned of \cGenesis{}'s big plans to upset the whole pantheon. It all came down to Magic. 

Magic is a gift given to the people of \pEarth{} by the patron deities of the three countries -- and it was a gift that you didn't get your fair share of. You are technically a magic user, but only barely. Things that others do without thinking are an incredible effort for you. You struggle to shape wood without tools -- you struggle to light a fire when others can do it with barely a thought. And even still, you have it far better than those born without magic at all. Magic was no gift to humanity -- it was a curse. And \cGenesis{} has promised to undo that curse, while simultaneously bringing forth a new era where everyone will be judged on their merit and their actions, instead of on how much privilege they were born with.

You've been working for almost a decade to build the necessary groundwork for that change. You forged the necessary papers to become a teacher at the \pSchool{}, arriving around the same time as \cPrince{\full} and \cChupInventor{\full}. \cChupLeader{} thinks that now is the time to make the bid for power, and thus reveal the \pGoaties{} and their true intentions to the world. You, on the other hand, fear that the group isn't ready. 

Your group's ostensible goal this weekend is to destroy the \pSc{} as a blow against the current pantheon and political structures of \pEarth{}. In reality, the plan goes two steps further -- destroying the \pSc{} will also end all magic on \pEarth{} by virtue of destroying the Ley Lines running through the island, and serve as an assassination of many of the assembled dignitaries. Only you and \cChupLeader{} know this, as you've kept it from \textbf{literally} everyone else present. In order to direct the Storm at the \pSc{}, \cChupLeader{} and \cChupInventor{} are working to make sure that a Relic attuned to the school is used in the Ritual to Control the Storm; the group's own Relic, the ``\iHorseshoe{}'', would be one option, as would re-attuning one or more of the other Relics. But you'll also need to make sure that enough students vote to direct the Storm at the \pSc{}, and right now your only student operative is \cChupStudent{\full}. Hopefully recruitment this weekend will change that. Still, you'll only get one chance at this and getting it to work is already uncertain. And you are not a gambling \cChupSecond{person}. It WOULD be a masterstroke if it worked -- but the problem you are preoccupied with is the aftermath. With so many of the highest ranking members held in the group partly or wholly by \cChupLeader{}'s charisma magic, ending magic right now could well end the \pGoaties{} too, and destroy everything you've built. You've devoted your life to this cause, and you won't let one over eager step bring it all to ruin. Someone has to be the adult in the room for this momentous decision. That's why you need to take control before \cChupLeader{} rushes headlong and ruins everything.

Of course, displacing the current leader, \cChupLeader{} is a delicate operation. You can't just throw \cChupLeader{\them} to the sharks, as it were – you'd reveal the whole group if you turned \cChupLeader{\them} over to the authorities. You considered trying to kill \cChupLeader{\them}, but killing beloved leaders tends to turn them into martyrs; besides, you'd have to either convince an Avenger to do it (a risky prospect) or risk amnesia by doing it yourself. No, you'll have to seize power some other way. You can theoretically call a vote of no confidence at any time, but you need to do something big, or \cChupLeader{} needs to fail badly, to guarantee the chips fall in your favor. To best stack the deck, you need to summon the Avatar of \cGenesis{}. Conveniently enough, \cChupLeader{} put you in charge of this task. The \pGoaties{} need to do this to level the playing field with the Patron Deities, making it a crucial group goal -- but it also has the useful side effect that whoever \textbf{leads} that ritual will wield enormous clout in the group afterward. No one would be able to deny that you are equally capable of leading once you summon the Avatar. Your claim will be further bolstered by the others who helped in the ritual. Their agreeing to work under you for this ritual will be nothing short of a pledge of loyalty to you.

Convincing \cChupInventor{} to join you could either be a piece of cake, or impossible. \cChupInventor{} has been with the group nearly as long as you. \cChupInventor{\Their} loyalty could go either way. If only you had a wedge to drive between \cChupInventor{} and \cChupLeader{}\ldots{} You wonder if \cChupLeader{} might be helping \cChupInventor{} cover up any secrets? \cChupLeader{} has a history of worming \cChupLeader{\their} way into people's hearts, only to throw them under the wagon when it suits \cChupLeader{\their} interests. If you can convince \cChupInventor{} that \cChupLeader{} is one breath away from selling \cChupInventor{\them} out, that could be the leverage you need; whether it is true or not is irrelevant.

And then there's the Avenger. Avenger's are \cGenesis{}'s secret weapon. Under the auspices of \cGenesis{}, someone who commits murder in \cGenesis{\their} name is forgotten by others, instead of forgetting themselves. Supposedly the upper echelons of the Followers are protected from forgetting because a tool forgotten is not of any use. But you are certain that you had arranged to have an Avenger here this weekend -- and you don't remember them! That's a bad sign, but of what you are not exactly sure. Either way, finding the Avenger and getting them on your side could be key. They should at least still remember that they are part of the cult. If Genesis smiles on you, they will remember you specifically and approach you, but you are prepared to do the legwork of finding them if they don't.

Lastly, there is \cChupStudent{}. You have been working with \cChupStudent{\them} to sabotage the magical Bunkers that protect people at the \pSchool{} during the run up to the Storm, and finally finished this morning. This sabotage is the \pGoaties{}'s main distraction from the work that \cChupLeader{} is overseeing. As long as \cChupLeader{} is in charge, and \cChupLeader{\their} plan is moving forward, you have to make sure people spend as little time as possible watching the Relics, lest the group's plot be revealed. Disrupting or delaying the repair crews working on the Bunkers for as long as possible is crucial for that. \cChupStudent{} is under the false impression that as long as the Bunkers still get repaired by the end of the weekend, they will protect everyone here from the Storm when it strikes the school. Only you and \cChupLeader{} know that even if the Bunkers are fixed, they will only be able to protect about half of those gathered from the full wrath of the Storm. If you decide to go through with the plan, you fully intend for the corrupt and decadent advisors from the three nations to be among those who don't survive, sending a powerful message to your enemies. Meanwhile, the luck of \cGenesis{} will protect you and your fellows from the the Storm with or without the Bunkers. 

Another way you can assist \cChupStudent{}, thereby currying favor with \cChupStudent{\them} and helping the group as a whole, is by convincing the \pTech{} teachers and the \pFarm{} advisors to rank \cChupStudent{\them} the highest for voting authority to direct the Storm. The plan to direct the Storm at the \pSc{} will only work if enough votes are cast for that option. As for other students you think should get the most votes, among the \pShip{} students, you find \cPirateChild{\full} to be particularly keen. You find \cPirateChild{\their} ability to view economic policy through a classist lens quite akin to your perspective with regards to magical ability. Since \cPirateChild{} is not in direct competition with \cChupStudent{}, you'd like to promote \cPirateChild{\them} to the \pFarm{} teachers and \pShip{} advisors for high ranking – especially if you can recruit \cPirateChild{} to the \pGoaties{}. For that matter, anyone else whom you think would be ripe for recruitment to the group might be worth approaching this weekend. After all, any new followers you bring in will be loyal to you, not \cChupLeader{}.

But maybe you are raising the sail before the wind. You manage a lot of things for the \pGoaties{}, and have a lot of things to keep an eye on this weekend. Your most important ongoing responsibility is managing and maintaining the black market. On \pEarth{}, the flow of goods, technology, and information is very tightly controlled. This leads to great demand among those who can't get things -- particularly new technology from the \pTech{} since the war started. This, in turn, led to an opportunity for a thriving black market -- and you put in the work to make it happen. Almost every serious technological gadget, weapon, resource, or snippet of information that is sold through the market passes through your hands. You take in supplies from all over, and send them out again. It's a lot of work, but it both maintains anonymity for as many people as possible while keeping transfer chains short, and ensures that no one can take that base of power away from you. Without you, the market would collapse within weeks, though not immediately -- you do work closely with \cChupInventor{}, who helps supply many of the goods coming out of the \pTech{}, especially weapons. A lot of your information comes from a rather unexpected source, \cEthics{\full}, the Ethics and Morality teacher. \cLibAssist{\full} serves as an intermediate to maintain your anonymity. \cEthics{} is operating under the delusion that the things \cEthics{\they} provide\cEthics{\plural} you with go directly and exclusively to support the \pShip{} war effort. In truth the war is moderately useful and you'd generally prefer it continue, since it so neatly distracts all of the governments from your activities, but you won't turn down a better deal to sell something elsewhere.

From the many things you've passed along recently, you took a particular interest in a \emph{liberated} load of goods from the \pFarm{}. The contact who passed off the fancy little box works with pirates, and they often have the most surprising little things for you. This box was no exception. It had a charm on it to keep it from being opened -- a very powerful, good quality one. Intrigued, you reached out to an eccentric curse worker you work with regularly albeit infrequently. \cCurse{\full} was delighted to work on so challenging a puzzle. But when \cCurse{\they} got the box open, and you saw the glint of something shiny and even better quality than the box. You snatched it away before \cCurse{} could get a good enough look to identify it. Then you sold the fancy ring and its box to one of your most reliable customers, \cHedonist{\full}.

Another useful thing you've gotten off of the black market recently was a juicy piece of information -- someone else seems to have designs on Avatars. There were unsubstantiated but credible rumors that one of the \pShip{} Avatars has been killed. This is valuable, pricey information that could sway the tide of the war in the right hands. Not only could that information fetch an incredible price on the black market, but it will give \cGenesis{} all the more of an edge. To complicate matters, however, you overheard \cFlowPriest{\full}, the \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of Flow, talking to \cInitiate{\full} and \cWarlordDaughter{\full} about trying to resurrect the Ebb avatar. That proved that the rumors are true, but also presented a problem – the \pShip{} clerics must be prevented from resurrecting the Ebb avatar. You have also heard through the black market that no Giant Hummingbirds, the Avatars of \cFarmGod{}, have been seen in six years. Could they be gone too? If so, it would give \cGenesis{} an even greater advantage to have \cGenesis{\their} Avatar on \pEarth{} while other Deities lack an Avatar on the mortal plane.

This weekend is a crucial turning point for you and the \pGoaties{}. You have a black market to run, a ritual to subvert, and an Avatar to summon -- not to mention your designs on group leadership, all of which you need to keep under wraps. Delegation will be your friend, so long as you can trust the people you are delegating to -- and trustworthy people are hard to come by. This weekend will make or break the \pGoaties{}. It is your job to see the group through to the other side.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Seize control of the \pGoaties{} before \cChupLeader{}'s overzealous approach destroys everything you've worked for. Once you have control, you'll have to make a decision on whether to proceed with the plan to send the Storm to the \pSc{} and destroy magic forever, or instead lay low and wait for a better time.
	\item Lead the ritual to summon the Avatar of \cGenesis{}. It's important both for the greater goals of the group, and because it will bolster your claim to the leadership role.
	\item Convince the \pTech{} teachers to rank \cChupStudent{} highest for voting authority to direct the Storm. Convince the \pFarm{} teachers to rank \cPirateChild{\full} highest.
	\item Work with \cChupStudent{} to keep as many people as possible distracted with repairing the Bunkers, disrupting and slowing the repair efforts as needed. 
	\item Work with \cChupInventor{} to maintain the black market. The Storm is always a busy time with all the advisors here.
	\item Figure out who the Avenger is and recruit them to your side if you can. While you're at it, recruit anyone else who strikes you as a strong asset, without exposing the \pGoaties{} to undue risk.
	\item Stop the \pShip{} clerics from resurrecting the Ebb avatar.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You've told the other members of the \pGoaties{} that the result of destroying the school will be only to cement \cGenesis{}'s place in the pantheon. Only you and \cChupLeader{} know that it will also end all human's ability to use magic, and will kill off around half of those gathered here, even if the Bunkers are repaired. You expect that many people would be opposed to this true purpose, including \cChupInventor{} and \cChupStudent{}.
	\item You teach economics at the \pSchool{}. You started teaching here 5 years ago, and so were not present for the Betrayal of the \pShip{} and mysterious deaths of the 12 students 6 years ago.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cChupLeader{}} The current leader of the \pGoaties{}. \cChupLeader{\Theyare} reckless and overzealous and \cChupLeader{\their} plans just might get the group destroyed.
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} Your second on the black market, \cChupInventor{} has been with the \pGoaties{} almost as long as you. You don't think \cChupInventor{\they}'d react well if  \cChupInventor{\they} knew that destroying the \pSc{} will end all magic in \pEarth{}.
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} The student you are working with to make sure the sabotaged Bunkers distract your adversaries for as long as possible. You aren't sure how \cChupStudent{\they}'d react if \cChupStudent{\they} knew that destroying the \pSc{} will kill around half of those present, even if the Bunkers are repaired, and will end all magic in \pEarth{}.
	\contact{\cEthics{}} A useful source for goods and information to sell on the black market. Seems particularly keen to pass secrets and tech on to the \pShip{}.
	\contact{\cLibAssist{}} Your messenger in the black market, acting as a useful intermediary between you and prospective customers. Blissfully unaware that the market is controlled by the \pGoaties{}.
	\contact{\cCurse{}} Your best curse-breaking and making contact. Eccentric, but a decent enough sort.
	\contact{\cHedonist{}} A \cHedonist{\cleric} of Luminary with a nigh insatiable taste for luxury contraband. As such, one of your best customers on the black market.
	\contact{\cPirateChild{\full}} A bright and outspoken \pShip{} student who views economic policy through a lens of class conflict and systemic oppression, much like your views of magic.
