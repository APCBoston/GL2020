Being a student at the \pSchool{} is a tremendous honor and a tremendous responsibility. You are \pEarth{}'s future leaders, in both a spiritual and secular sense. You were picked for excellence in academics, religion, magic, and more. You are the best of the best that \pEarth{} has to offer. You spend three years at the \pSchool{}. During that time, you take classes in a wide variety of subjects, and work on independent projects. You hone your skills, your critical thinking, and your magic. And at the end of it, you go on to be some of the most influential people in your nation.

Your time at the \pSc{} is one of learning, growing, and forging life long friendships. The connections you make here will help you for the rest of your life. But not everyone is friendly with each other, even from the same country. There's only one top student spot, and for a group used to being big fish in small ponds, the competition can get fierce. Things get even worse when national loyalty comes into play. Rivalries often split along these lines, and the conflict can turn quite dirty.

Those of you who are present during the Time of Deciding have a particular set of challenges ahead of you. \textbf{You must decide where to send the Storm, and then live with that knowledge for the rest of your life.} The Storm is a cruel choice. People will die. Livelihoods will be destroyed. But you must choose. To choose not to choose is also a choice, and it is the bloodiest of all. An uncontrolled storm will kill many more than a controlled one as it rages across all three nations.

The burden is heavy, but you are not alone in it. Most of your teachers and Advisors have participated in this ritual before. They have all learned to bear the burden. They may have advice for you -- do not squander the resource their advice can be. And you have your fellow students here with you now -- you will collectively share the responsibility for this year's Decision. You can and should discuss and debate amongst each other as well. Do not take this responsibility lightly.

But do not let it consume you either. Some of you are graduating this year. Some of you just started at the \pSchool{}. You have your whole adult lives ahead of you. You are young, and full of potential. \pSc{} is a time for joy and fun, for connection, friendship, romance, and more. It is a time to try things, to make mistakes, and to grow and change. You are the future of \pEarth{}. What will you make? Who will you be? How will you change the future?

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Decide individually, and ideally collectively, where to send the Storm. The Advisors and Teachers will have a lot to say on the matter, but the decision is ultimately yours.
	\item Cast your votes once you are given the voting tokens on Sunday morning.
	\item Design and Execute the Ritual to Control the Storm.
	\item Attend the Ceremony of Excellence to be recognized, or support your fellow students.
	\item Make the \pSc{} proud.
\end{itemz}
