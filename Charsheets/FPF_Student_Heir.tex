%%Megan AKA FPF Student Heir

Name:  \cHeir{}

You are \cHeir{} (\cHeir{\they}/\cHeir{\them}), and 21 years old.  It’s your third and final year at \pSchool{} - which means that this is your last chance, for so many things.  As the reluctant Heir to the elite Faledon family, a family with an exclusive Council seat and a tech and manufacturing empire, your future is all but written in stone, whether you like it or not. At least, that’s what they think! You’ve got a plan they’ll all hate that will earn you your freedom, and probably save the company from your own disinterest.  You have no interest in the family business, and would rather enjoy your future in freedom, even if you don’t know what you’d do with it. You’re also, after so many failed attempts, absolutely not going to leave this school without discovering what happened to your \cHeirSibling{/sibling}, \cHeirSibling{}, and all the other students who were murdered after voting to direct the Storm six years ago. The one responsible will most likely be here again at this crucial juncture - and you’re not going to let them get away emph{this} time.

The succession to the Faledon empire is a tangled web that you’re trying to escape - but if you take it apart piece by piece, you should be able to manage it all. The most crucial part of the puzzle is getting out of your position as Heir to the Faledon family business, and all that goes with it. Apparently a distant ancestor of yours wanted to make REALLY sure that there would never be competition for or absence of a Faledon Heir, and so set up a generation-spanning blood magic ritual as insurance. That spells ensures that the oldest child, the Heir, was stuck with the job - and that any siblings are made too magically loyal to the Heir to conspire to murder them for the position even if they’d otherwise want to. Happily for you, they neglected to make their children magically loyal to the family in the same way. Their arrogant assumption that loyalty to the family would be absolute got the better of them there.

Your family would like you to believe it’s impossible to escape this bond - but through extensive research, you’ve discovered a way. You can simply complete an obscure ritual involving blood magic of your own (oh, the horror!). The ritual you discovered was only supposed to be known by the Head of the family in case an older child is somehow unqualified for the job, and can be used to transfer the blood bond from you to someone else, making them irreversibly the Heir. Luckily, the ‘who’ part of this is easy!  Your good friend \cAmbition{} would love nothing more than to shoulder the burden, and to wield the power that you’re so desperate to escape. With your supreme disinterest and \cAmbition{\their} brains, you’re sure \cAmbition{\they} will do a much better job of leading the family and the business.  

Since your family won’t approve, and blood magic is taboo, you’ll need to be sneaky about it.  That will be especially complicated this weekend, since \cDiplomat{} will be here, but the timing can’t be helped.  This weekend is the last and best chance, and the reward will be worth the risk. You’ll need to make sure the transfer of power from you to \cAmbition{} is complete not just magically, but socially, so you also need to make sure that \cAmbition{\they} wield the highest voting authority in the Ritual to control the Storm instead of you. Of course, \cDiplomat{} will be in your way here, as well\ldots 

Actually, it’s alarming, and you suppose typical of your family’s meddling intentions, that \cDiplomat{} is so frequently in your business. It’s like your family has \cDiplomat{\them} instructed to make extra sure that you toe the line. Ugh. Come to think of it, \cDiplomat{} was involved in the treaty (aka the betrayal of the \pShippies{}) that was signed the same weekend \cHeirSibling{} was murdered. You suspect that may not be a coincidence, and feel a simmering hatred deep down that is just waiting for proof of \cDiplomat{}’s involvement to bloom into full blown loathing.

As if that’s not bad enough, \cDiplomat{} was, of course, also the one who arranged your betrothal so many years ago to \cChupStudent{}.  Your feelings about that have recently become\ldots  complicated.  As children you and \cChupStudent{} were like oil and water, blaming one another for the betrothal forced on you both by \cDiplomat{} and your parents.  

Since you’ve seen \cChupStudent{\them} at school, however, your feelings have definitely started to change, which is confusing.  \cChupStudent{} sure grew up HOT since you last saw \cChupStudent{\them} a couple of years before, and you haven’t had the courage to really engage \cChupStudent{\them} in conversation yet because you’re pretty sure \cChupStudent{\they} still can’t stand you. You keep finding your eyes drawn back to \cChupStudent{\them} again and again, and it’s been a massive drain to keep your mind focused on the task at hand.  

At least you might have a chance with \cPresident{}, who also draws your interest. You’ve caught \cPresident{} sneaking glances at you from across the room many times. At first, it was just an interest in what kind of person \cPresident{\they} \cPresident{\were} - but on starting to pay attention to \cPresident{\them}, you realized there was a lot to like. Student body president, smooth talker, and easy on the eyes as well, you soon found yourself wondering what life would be like with \cPresident{} as well. It would be really nice if you could be with both at the same time, but you’re all from different walks of life - and different nations to boot. At the very least, the ongoing war would mean that a relationship with \cPresident{} would be across battle lines - that is, unless the war were to be resolved soon.

While you’re busy with the important business of discovering \cHeirSibling{}’s killer and escaping your fate as the Faledon Heir, you also have some ideas about how to get back at \cDiplomat{} for the mess \cDiplomat{\they} \cDiplomat{\have} made of your life. Your friend \cWarlordDaughter{} is trying to figure out why \cWarlordDaughter{\their} \cLoud{\parent} has taken on the mantle of Warlord to the \pShippies{}, in a complete reversal of \cLoud{\their} earlier pacifistic attitudes, and you know if you can help \cWarlordDaughter{}, you might also help ease the path of the three nations to forge a new treaty and end the war. Since \cDiplomat{} was the creator of the original ``treaty'' that led to the start of the war, this would be a real triumph over \cDiplomat{\them}. \cDiplomat{} isn’t the only one who can manipulate a situation to accomplish their goals!  

You’re also interested to see the presentation \cHeadScientist{} is giving this weekend.  The treaty \cDiplomat{} made with \pFarm{} relies completely on the promise that \pTech{} will provide a technological way to permanently end the Storm, without impacting the existence of Magic. You’ve heard your \cFaledonParent{\parent} talking about it with visiting Council members at your home.  What strikes you, and apparently your \cFaledonParent{\parent} as well, is that your company has not yet been approached to manufacture anything, and you’ve got the market basically cornered on manufacturing. Maybe you’ll be able to learn something here, and maybe, just maybe, it’ll be something that you can use against \cDiplomat{}\ldots

In between everything else going on this weekend, you hope there’ll be enough time for you to also get involved in the Graduation Presentation that \cMusic{} is organizing. You’d really like to take the opportunity to showcase your skills - and maybe catch the interest of certain individuals - by becoming a demonstrator during the show. You are, of course, the most qualified individual, so it will be a win-win for the school.

Ultimately, while you’re desperate to escape the choking grasp of your fate, and sticking it to \cDiplomat{} would be the triumph of a lifetime, the mission that lies closest to your heart is seeking out the one responsible for murdering \cHeirSibling{} and the other students six years ago. Even if you had to sacrifice everything else you care about to do it, it would be worth it to you. You are going to get to the truth, and nothing is going to stop you. This weekend is your chance to leave the powerlessness of childhood behind and grab your own destiny with both hands. Maybe some freedom will even let you figure out what it is you DO want to do with your life! Whatever it is, wherever, and with whomever, your future will be your own once you can get closure for your \cHeirSibling{\sibling}s murder and free yourdelf from the family lineage. Not to mention how happy it would make \cAmbition{} to take over the yoke of leadership that you loathe. Your \cFaledonParent{\parent} may not like it at first, but you know that everything you are doing this weekend will ultimately benefit the Faledon family as well.

%However, they think the other person hates them still since that’s how it’s always been.
%Also, from different nations (FPF and CoS), neither wants to move to the other’s nation
%Megan is also crushing on / involved with Ross - don’t start game thinking poly is an option

%Megan \cHeir{} is screw the man, an easy sell.  Matt \cAmbition{} will be harder - need to make it clear to Matt \cAmbition{} that more likely to get power by toeing the line (much less rebellious than Matt).  Only reason why they will accept Matt \cAmbition{} is that they see that Matt \cAmbition{} will run business how they want it run.  Whereas Megan \cHeir{} is a chaos beast and they don't want their empire in her hands or has run for the hills.

	\item You are graduating this year.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} has long been the ally of the Faledon Family, and as such is a persistent thorn in your side, and maybe worse. As the creator of the treaty forged six years ago that brought about the betrayal of the \pShip{} by \pTech{} and \pFarm{}, \cDiplomat{} is ultimately responsible for the current war between the nations.
	\contact{\cAmbition{}} is your close friend who has seen you through thick and thin, and you can think of nobody better qualified, or more eager, for the kind of power your family wields.  \cAmbition{} is everything you aren’t, and for some reason, that’s only brought you closer as friends.
	\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} is a friend from \pShip{} who you’ve grown closer to recently.  As the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of the Warlord leading the \pShippies{} so successfully into battle, \cWarlordDaughter{} seems as unlike \cWarlordDaughter{\their} family as you are.
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} is your intended future spouse, and as such was of course your childhood irritation.  That’s all changed now though, and you’d like nothing better than to start over with a clean slate and get to know \cChupStudent{\them} better romantically. If only they felt the same\ldots
	\contact{\cPresident{}} is charming to say the least, and it seems like \cPresident{\they} might return your interest. Why is love so complicated??? Your heart can’t seem to settle for one person or the other.
