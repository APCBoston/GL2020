\name{\cChupAvenger{}}


You are \cChupAvenger{\full} (\cChupAvenger{\they}/\cChupAvenger{\them}), a 43 year old Art teacher from the \pShip{}, and, to your great regret, Avenger of \cGenesis{}. When the war began, you were blinded by anger at the betrayal of your country's long-time allies, and made the rash decision to join the \pGoaties{}. Since then, you have calmed down, had a change of heart - and finally now, after bringing your existence to the brink of erasure, realized how desperately you need a way out.

You grew up on a loving ship amid a loving family, loving life on the waves and appreciating the beauty of the world around you. Your teenage years were primarily defined by travel as you toured many boats, and eventually, the other countries, cultivating a healthy love for the natural beauty of the world and honing your skills as a virtuoso in all kinds of art - the act of creating life from a canvas, the art of cutting away stone and wood to reveal the beauty within, and the skill of shaping clay to your will. 

Just as you were settling down back in your beloved \pShip{}, you were approached with a job offer to the prestigious \pSchool{} as the Art teacher. You started teaching at the \pSc{} 8 years ago, and have met many friends among your coworkers, including the librarian, \cLibrarian{\full}. You also stuck up a friendship with \cPrincipal{\full}, bonding over your shared love of the \pShippies{}, a place \cPrincipal{\they} \cPrincipal{\have} not seen in years due to the limitations placed on being Principal.

When the \pShip{} were betrayed, you were outraged. You, having seen the beauty that harmony had wrought in the world, could not fathom the sheer audacious evil of the other countries. Your anger was palpable, and you were quickly recruited by \cChupSecond{\full} to join with like-minded people who all wanted to do something about it - the \pGoaties{}. You took a lengthy sabbatical to become one of their early members. In a word, you became an Avenger - an assassin who is forgotten by others, instead of forgetting; a special ``boon'' of \cGenesis{}.

The structure of the \pGoaties{} is deliberately divided into cells. Still, as one of the group's early members (and one of it's very few avengers), you know \cChupLeader{\full} as the head of the \pGoaties{}. \cChupLeader{} has always been a firebrand — impatient, reckless, and hot headed. \cChupLeader{\They} \cChupLeader{\have} done wonders to advance the \pGoaties{} cause, but every decision \cChupLeader{\they} make\cChupLeader{\plural} is a gamble, and not always a calculated one. \cChupSecond{} is the more level headed second in command. \cChupSecond{\They} play\cChupSecond{\plural} the long game, and is much better at waiting until success is assured to strike. Sometimes \cChupSecond{\they} wait too long. Lately there has been tension between these two. You don't have a strong opinion since you intend to leave, but if forced to pick, you figure the \pGoaties{} probably have the best long term chance of survival if \cChupLeader{} were to step aside in favor of \cChupSecond{}. 

All of your family, and most of your friends have forgotten you by now. \cLibrarian{} in particular seems to be taking it really hard. \cLibrarian{\They} \cLibrarian{\have} been acting especially strange of late. But of all the people who've forgotten about you as a result of your activities, \cHeadScientist{\full}, the love of your life, is the hardest. The two of you had a rock-solid romantic relationship, built on love, trust, and mutual interests. But now \cHeadScientist{\they} \cHeadScientist{\does}n't remember anything about you. Not even your first date, on which you brought \cHeadScientist{\them} a dozen red roses (or the many subsequent bouquets of black crocuses after learning they were \cHeadScientist{\their} favorite). Maybe \cHeadScientist{}'s best friend, your fellow teacher \cChupInventor{\full}, would be willing to help you rekindle your romance, but you would have to provide some explanation for why \cHeadScientist{\they} no longer remember\cHeadScientist{\plural} you. Or there is your favorite student, \cInitiate{\full}, who already knows that \cHeadScientist{} has forgotten you. You didn't mean for \cInitiate{} to find out, but perhaps it was meant to be. Ebb and Flow encourage their followers to give their prayers to the sea breeze, which will carry the prayer to the ears of the Goddesses. Even though the Goddesses have no reason to answer your prayer since you forsook them, you sent one anyway. But sometimes other mortals overhear prayers sent on the wind. This time, \cInitiate{} overheard you, and is now determined to help. You can't help but wonder if \cInitiate{\theyare} the Goddess' answer to your prayers, unworthy though you might be. Still, the two of you haven't addressed the whale in the room yet of how \cHeadScientist{} forgot you in the first place. You'll have to figure out an explanation that avoids implicating \cHeadScientist{} or you in anything you can't talk your way out of. Regardless, you are grateful for \cInitiate{}'s help, and intend to repay \cInitiate{\their} kindness by helping \cInitiate{\them} win the most voting authority to direct the Storm. 

It was this particular instance of amnesia that finally woke you up to the true price you were paying. The \pGoaties{} may have a noble cause, and you have met many good people in the organization, but ultimately, it isn't a cause worth throwing away your life and legacy for. It was amidst these thoughts that your closest friend \cPrincipal{\full} figured out what was going on and confronted you. \cPrincipal{\They} tr\cPrincipal{\pluralY} to maintain a certain professional distance from most of the teachers, and you suspect that \cPrincipal{\their} immortality also plays a role in \cPrincipal{\their} distance, but around you, \cPrincipal{\they} let\cPrincipal{\plural} down \cPrincipal{\their} guard and can just be human. So when confronted, you decided to come clean to \cPrincipal{\them} about your situation. After your initial explanation, \cPrincipal{} surprised you by accepting what you had done and instead of condemnation, gave you help and advice on how to escape your plight. It is an escape that you hope to complete this weekend. It will not be easy – you must reconcile with Ebb and Flow, and convince the clerics to induct you back into the religion. That will be awkward, since publicly you never left the faith. The clerics won't be able to tell if you've completed your reconciliation, but the avatar summoned as part of the conversion will. Of the two Clerics of Ebb and Flow available to you, \cFlowPriest{\full}, your fellow teacher, is more forgiving than \cEbbPriest{\full}, one of the advisors (at least by reputation; you've never met \cEbbPriest{} in person). You \emph{might} be able to admit your situation to \cFlowPriest{} and get \cFlowPriest{\their} help, but it could easily backfire if \cFlowPriest{\they} tell\cFlowPriest{\plural} \cEbbPriest{}.

Unfortunately for you, while all members of the \pGoaties{} that you know at present seem to have forgotten you since the incident a few weeks ago, you won't be able to stay under the radar for long. Your first naive attempt to leave the group peacefully ended violently after you were forced to kill the officer you spoke to about it in self defense. While you are quite certain that you managed to clean that mess up by framing the \pGoaties{} enemies, the death did not go unnoticed by \cGenesis{} \cGenesis{\them}self. You have been divinely censured for your actions. You must publicly and prominently display the clover pin, the secret symbol of the \pGoaties{}, wherever you go. This will unfortunately ensure that any present cult members and any savvy enemies of the cult will know your unwanted affiliation. You'll need to come up with some explanation for the public display of what is supposed to be a secret symbol.

After the betrayal of six years ago, you feel determined to make sure this Time of Deciding goes off without any outside interference. There is little doubt in your mind that agents from the \pTech{} and the \pFarm{} somehow rigged the vote six years ago to send the Storm to the \pShip{}, and that those same agents will likely try to do so again. As such, you intend to keep a close eye on the proceedings, including making sure no one tampers with the voting stones or the Relics needed for the Ritual to Control the Storm, by volunteering to help with the preparations for said ritual. If you can catch any would-be saboteurs in the act and get justice for the betrayal of the \pShip{}, so much the better. You are loath to kill anyone else and be forgotten by even more people, but if you can publicly expose their treachery or turn them over to the \pShip{} authorities \emph{(OOC: post game)}, that would suffice.

Overall, your current situation is extremely complex, and the only way you really see out is forward. Getting out of the \pGoaties{}, renouncing \cGenesis{}, and getting back into \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}'s good graces will not be trivial, but it's your most important goal this weekend. If you can manage them, preventing any tampering with the Ritual to Control the Storm and getting back into a relationship with \cHeadScientist{} would both take a load off of your mind as well. 

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Get out of the \pGoaties{} and avoid negative consequences for your crimes in \cGenesis{}'s name, without betraying the rest of the group to the authorities, for their cause is righteous, you just cannot personally be a part of it any more.
	\item Make sure the Storm does not get sent to the \pShip{}. To that end, help \cInitiate{} win the most voting authority to direct the Storm by convincing the \pFarm{} teachers and \pShip{} advisors to rank \cInitiate{\them} the highest.
	\item Make sure no one tampers with the voting stones or the Relics needed for the ritual to control the Storm, and help the ritual go off successfully and without interference. 
	\item Rekindle your forgotten romance with \cHeadScientist{} and keep \cHeadScientist{\them} out of the \pGoaties{}'s way.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You teach Art at the \pSchool{}.
	\item Different teachers stay for different Times of Deciding. Six years ago, you were still a fairly new teacher, and had no particular desire to stay anyway, so you were not present at the \pSc{} that weekend.
	\item You know that the \pGoaties{} are planning something big this weekend, but you don't know what — they all forgot about you before you could be briefed on the mission. Whatever it is, you want no part of it, but nor do you intend to interfere.
	\item You are obligated to wear a 4-leaf clover visibly on your person. You may provide a prop for this yourself, else the GMs will have one available for you to attach to your costume or name badge.
\end{itemz}
