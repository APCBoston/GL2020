\name{\cInterpol{}}

You are \cInterpol{} (\cInterpol{\they}/\cInterpol{\them}), a 32 year old secret agent who is glad to be back in the field. You are both a \cInterpol{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{} and a high ranking member of \pInterpol{}, under cover at the \pSchool{} as the Combat teacher. Your current, crucial mission is to infiltrate the \pGoaties{} and stop their plot. This would be easier if you didn’t find yourself agreeing with the \pGoaties{} more often than not.

You know their words are propaganda, but even so, they’re hard to resist. They speak about how \cFarmGod{} has forsaken the common people -- and as a \cInterpol{\cleric} of that very \cFarmGod{\God}, you’ve seen first hand that this is mostly true. Too often, the prayers of the common people seem to go unanswered in favor of divine favor for the nobility, making it very clear that the system is out of balance. Not that balance is everything (that’s a very \pShip{} belief), but surely a \cFarmGod{\God} owes something to all of \cFarmGod{\their} followers -- not just the ones that can afford gold for tithing. The \pGoaties{} seem to be offering a nearly perfect solution -- true equity for all people. Such a lofty ambition seems a little\dots too perfect -- and the group has been rumored to have its fingers in a emph{lot} of shady business. But still, that’s why you are here -- to find out if it really is too good to be true. 

You started in the priesthood from a fairly early age. You were a moderately powerful magic user from a moderately powerful family; nothing particularly special, but you worked hard, harder than anyone else in your cohort. Eventually, your hard work got you noticed and recruited into an inner circle of the priesthood that works directly with \pInterpol{}, a secret international law enforcement entity with jurisdiction across all three nations. Given access to equipment and information, you accomplished a number of rather remarkable things. Single handedly saving an orphanage and shutting down a crime ring - it was all in a day's work for you. But you were slightly too effective for your own good. Your superiors pulled you off of field work much too soon, and set you to dispatching others.

But then the war happened, and \pInterpol{}, previously an international organization, splintered. Greatly reduced in personnel and resources, you’ve struggled somewhat since to find direction. You found that direction in the rising threat of the \pGoaties{}, a clear and present threat to the current power structure. With no one better suited to the task of intelligence gathering and your roster as diminished as it was, you chose to assign yourself the field position on this case and started the exacting work of forging the papers you’d need.

You soon found that you aren’t as rusty as you feared. You’ve got some pretty good leads on infiltrating the inner circle of the \pGoaties{} after only a few months' work. You are 90 percent sure that \cChupInventor{}, the Political Science teacher, is involved at a very high level. You aren’t as sure about \cChupSecond{}, or \cWildCard{} -- those are more of a toss up. They are definitely up to \emph{something}, but you don’t know what yet for sure. Still, you haven’t been invited to any secret meetings yet, so your work isn’t done. 

To combat the fact that you have no history with the group up to this point, you’ve prepared yourself to pose as an Avenger. An Avenger is an obscure concept, talked about only in the quietest whispers -- a person who kills on behalf of the God \cGenesis{} and is forgotten by others instead of forgetting themselves. Your cover story is that you have been killing so many targets for the group that even the group’s members have forgotten you -- and, conveniently, you’re just one assassination away from being forgotten by existence entirely, and are understandably reluctant to take that last step.

With this cover, you hope that you can determine the true intentions of the \pGoaties{}, and fast. Your sources suggest they are planning something big for this weekend. If they mean to elevate \cGenesis{} to the same rank as the patron Gods as a \cGenesis{\Deity} of Luck on the side the masses, that’s something you can get behind. You may even be willing to risk your career to let it slide. But if they are up to something else -- assassinating heads of government, destroying priceless artifacts at the \pSchool{}, doing something that would make life harder for the masses -- that, you cannot allow.

Your cover is a necessary one for the immediacy required of this mission, but it does make your secondary job -- that of being a priest of \cFarmGod{} -- significantly harder. You have (wisely, as it turns out) kept your status as a \cInterpol{\cleric} under wraps, leaving your fellow \pFarm{} \cHedonist{\cleric} \cHedonist{} as the only person who knows about this. However, you still have priestly duties to perform -- most importantly, making sure that the artifacts used for the Ritual, especially the \iScythe{}, stay present, attuned, and intact. The \iScythe{} is a powerful weapon, when empowered by attunement, and considering the presence of the \pGoaties{} this weekend, you want to ensure it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. Anyone wanting to use the \iPitcher{} in the Ritual in place of the \iScythe{} would be a good suspect to look into. Of course you’ll also need to be sure that any less important rituals are taken care of. You will either need to perform these duties clandestinely, or make sure that \cHedonist{} can pick up your slack.

Poking around the school, you’ve acquired a few other random tidbits, none of which are useful on their own but one never knows. \cPirateChild{} is a thief, and a good one at that. Good enough to get in and out of \cChupInventor{}’s office undetected -- something even you have yet to manage. Maybe \cPirateChild{} could be persuaded to help you somehow? 

You also found a rather personal letter addressed to \cLibrarian{}, ostensibly from \cLibrarian{\their} parents. It offers condolences about a fairly recent break up with a \cEthics{}, who teaches ethics and morality, over some unspecified unethical behavior. Ironic, to be sure -- but not big news. The more interesting part makes veiled references to a murder (!) by \cLibrarian{}. If true, that would make \cLibrarian{} an amnesiac. With a little investigation, you determined that this theory DOES seem to line up with \cLibrarian{\their} apparent spate of odd behavior as of late. However, you consider yourself quite a good judge of character -- you’d be dead half a dozen times over if you weren’t -- and you know \cLibrarian{} is a good person. So who did \cLibrarian{} kill, and why? Naturally \cLibrarian{} won’t remember -- but maybe those close to \cLibrarian{\them} would.

Posing as a teacher has come with it’s own set of challenges. You knew being a teacher was hard work, but you weren’t prepared for the kids to require so much reassurance and guidance. You teach Combat -- a wholly necessary class in which students learn to defend themselves with both magic and mundane weapons. The biggest challenge you’ve faced has always been the fear of injury - so you forged a document granting you special dispensation from the priesthood to perform healing magic even though you are supposedly not a \cInterpol{\cleric}. Yada, yada, don’t share the spells on pain of death, blah, blah, only in the service of \cFarmGod{}. Such dispensations are exceedingly rare but not completely unheard of. However, this system has always bothered you -- what if someone didn’t have access to a Priest? What if one of your students got hurt when you weren’t around to help? If the music for healing could somehow be more widely distributed - if the priesthood would loosen their clenched fist - you feel like it would be better for everyone. But it’s not like you can bottle music\ldots

Speaking of music, you’ve found a friend in the Music teacher, \cMusic{}. While \cMusic{\they} \cMusic{\are}n’t a \cMusic{\cleric} \cMusic{\themself}, \cMusic{\they} understand \cMusic{\plural} music’s value and its place in religion.  This has allowed you to bond over this central piece of both of your lives, even if you’ve only told \cMusic{\them} you wish you could be a \cInterpol{\cleric}. So when you found yourself having romantic feelings for the Religion teacher, \cBeetle{}, you turned to \cMusic{} for help. \cMusic{} in turn let you know that \cBeetle{} is polyamorous and in an established relationship with \cJuniorStatesman{}. At first you figured this would all be straightforward enough -- simply find the right time to approach \cBeetle{} and talk about your feelings -- until \cJuniorStatesman{} showed up this morning. \cJuniorStatesman{} is attractive, intelligent, and kind -- and honestly every bit as intriguing, in \cJuniorStatesman{\their} own way. However, this last second addition very much complicates the plan you and \cMusic{} hatched to talk to \cBeetle{} about a possible relationship while \cBeetle{\their} other partner was in town. Triads (relationships where all three partners are involved with one another) are a lot harder to maintain than Vees (relationships where one person has two partners who are not in a relationship) -- but you think \cJuniorStatesman{} might be worth it. Assuming, of course, that it’s even possible to start two brand new relationships at the same time\ldots Regardless of what you decide, the three of you will have a lot to talk about. You are very glad you have \cMusic{} to help figure out how to approach them.

The last big thing on your mind is the strange behavior of one \pFarm{} student named \cLibAssist{}. You’re not sure why, but you’re pretty sure that they’ve been keeping an eye on you -- and you’re getting definite shady vibes. You should find out what \cLibAssist{\they} know\cLibAssist{\plural} and find a way to keep it from getting out. No way are you letting someone barely half your age get the better of you.

This will be a busy weekend. Not only do you need to infiltrate a cult (and decide what to do once you’re there), you also need to fulfill your priestly duties, keep your secrets under wraps, and figure out how to deal with your love life. It will be a lot to handle -- but it’s nothing you’re not used to. You’re the best of the best, and you intend to prove it.


\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Infiltrate and assess the true intentions of the \pGoaties{}. Stop their plan if you deem it unjust
	\item Start a romantic relationship with \cBeetle{} and/or \cJuniorStatesman{}
	\item Find a way to make magical healing more readily available
	\item Keep the ritual relics safe and fulfill your other priestly duties
\item Investigate the Librarian’s strange behavior and determine how to handle it
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]

\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} The Political Science teacher, who you haven’t had much contact with -- but are 90 percent sure is a high ranking member of the \pGoaties{}. Likely your surest way into the group.
\contact{\cWildCard{}} An advisor who you know little about. Your sources weren’t certain, but also a possible member of the \pGoaties{}. 
	\contact{\cChupSecond{}} The Economics teacher, relatively isolated from the other teachers. Your sources weren’t certain, but also a possible member of the \pGoaties{}
	\contact{\cHedonist{}} Your fellow \pFarm{} \cHedonist{\cleric}. Only somewhat reliable, but a good sort -- and more importantly, all you’ve got this weekend to cover your religious duties. 
	\contact{\cPirateChild{}} A student and a thief. Proficient enough to get into and out of sensitive rooms undetected, and could therefore be useful.  
	\contact{\cLibrarian{}} The Librarian, and a reliable person until they became an amnesiac -- and therefore, most likely a murderer. But you’ve always thought of them as a good person\ldots 
	\contact{\cMusic{}} Your teacher friend who you share your love of music with 
\contact{\cBeetle{}} An attractive \cBeetle{\cleric} from \pTech{}, and your fellow teacher. You’d very much like to start up a romantic relationship with \cBeetle{\them}.
	\contact{\cJuniorStatesman{}} Attractive, intelligent, kind, and complicatedly enough, \cBeetle{}’s polyamorous, usually long-distance, partner. You’d like to strike up a romantic relationship with \cJuniorStatesman{\them} too.
	\contact{\cLibAssist{}} A \pFarm{} student who has been acting extremely sketchy as of late. You need to figure out what is going on with \cLibAssist{\them}.
\end{contacts}
