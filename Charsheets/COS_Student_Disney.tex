%% Stephanie AKA COS Student Disney

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the character's current life, problems, and priorities. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life. Current life and situation.   What they think about the most important contacts

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.

Person out of time - ""sleeping beauty"", spent a large number of years asleep

Switch between two extremes - has an angry side during which she gets very strong

Priest in training"	Sam Tillis' character is the one that finally woke her up.  Spent years of his life working on this puzzle starting from when he was young until he was older.  Finally cracked it.  Attached to her but not in a romantic kind of way	Stephanie's character is a sweet, cinnamon role character, full of love of life and re-discovering the world after so long asleep.  Really wants to do good for the world, really rather innocent and pure.  Had built Sam's character up on a pedastal, but hadn't spent enough time around him to realize that he's really not the person she thought he was.  After spending more time together, realizes that he's actually not a good person / manipulative and into dark stuff
