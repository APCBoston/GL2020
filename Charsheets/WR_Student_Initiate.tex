%Rebecca AKA WR Student Initiate

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves.

You are \cInitiate{\full} (\cInitiate{\they}/\cInitiate{\them}) and a student at \pSchool{}. Mature for your age at 22 years old, you are an Initiate in the priesthood of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}, with a life of meaning and devotion ahead of you. You are from \pShip{}, but your parents ran away from \pFarm{} and that history has made your life\ldots complicated of late. You are passionate about magic and your religion, but also engineering and using magic to build. With the help of your best friend, \cPresident{\full}, there is a lot you intend to accomplish before you graduate this weekend.

You were born in the 2nd fleet and grew up alongside \cPresident{} and for many years the two of you did everything together - until the time came to go to academy. You went to the 1st fleet academy to study religion with the intent to enter the priesthood, while \cPresident{\they} went to 2nd fleet academy, to study politics. Reunited by the Goddesses’ own good fortune with your best friend here at the \pSchool{}, the two of you are more or less unstoppable!

Unstoppable, that is, except for the bad luck. Three months ago, you received a \iCursedLetter{} from your long lost family in the \pFarm{}. They demanded your immediate return to the \pFarm{} to take your rightful place in the family and continue the bloodline. You had no such inclination to do so initially - your immediate family immigrated to \pShip{} to escape these people before you were even born, after all, so you have no connection or interest in them beyond the last generation’s bad blood. However, the bargaining chip that the letter spoke of, a curse of bad luck, was inflicted on you by the letter itself - and its continued influence on your life has begun to wear you down. You have had no luck in dispelling the curse on your own, and not even appeals to the Goddesses have helped. You regularly stay up late talking with \cPresident{} and \cWarlordDaughter{}, another initiate to the priesthood who is here at the school, about what to do. \cWarlordDaughter{} is surprisingly sentimental for someone who is the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of \cLoud{\full}, the warlord who started and leads the \pShip{} war effort. \cWarlordDaughter{\They} often encourage\cWarlordDaughter{\plural} you to at least give your family in \pFarm{} a chance. \cPresident{}, on the other hand, is convinced that if you went to your grandparents' place they would never let you leave.  With their heavy handed efforts to get you back, you certainly see his point.  Either way, you’ve got to get rid of this curse somehow! Then you can figure out if you want to go visit your grandparents.

There's another important decision to make this weekend - you've been putting off picking a path for your priesthood. You will need to pick one Goddess to primarily serve, and with both \cEbbPriest{}, a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} or Ebb and \cFlowPriest{} devoted to Flow, here, this weekend it's a pretty good opportunity. In fact, if you end up deciding to return to your extended family, it may be your ONLY opportunity. And, as a side benefit, it would be really nice to have access to the full range of power that a \cInitiate{\cleric} has.

One important wrinkle in this plan is that without the \cEbb{} Avatar alive and well, your only choice is the path of \cFlow{}. While \cFlow{} isn’t a bad choice, you would like to keep your options open. That’s why, when \cFlowPriest{} came to you with a surprising opportunity to resurrect the Avatar, you were shocked and excited to help. You just hope you can be of assistance in this important secret quest!

Before you get too lost in your future though, it's worth engaging with the opportunities of the present. Chief among these is the chance to study with \cBunker{} when \cBunker{\they} arrive with the \pShip{} delegation to inspect the Bunkers that keep people safe from the Storm at the \pSc{}, while its power builds this weekend. The wonderful thing about \pShippies{} magic is the craftsmanship, and you don’t want to pass up a chance to see such an engineering marvel in action.

You also intend to look out for what is best for \pShip{}. You plan to keep an eye on, and take a hand in, setting up the ritual to control the storm. You care for your homeland, and by making sure the ritual is arranged correctly, you can ensure no one is up to anything shady that might screw over the \pShippies{} again.

Aside from your own plans, you are happy to support \cPresident{} in \cPresident{\theirs}. \cPresident{} is looking into what happened to the students six years ago, when the storm was sent out of turn. You suspect that investigation might end up requiring\ldots religious support, but without any way to guess which adults were involved in that mess, you're a much safer option - hopefully the power you have as an initiate will be enough. Your sense of camaraderie with \cPresident{} even goes so far as to wing\cInitiate{\person} for them in matters of love. This being \cPresident{}'s graduation weekend too, \cPresident{\they} \cPresident{\have} left it a little late, but such is the way of things. You think that \cPresident{} could make a good couple with either \cHeir{}or \cChupStudent{} - or both of them! You just have to figure out how to get them all to open up to each other about their feelings.

Maybe romance is just in the air. You unintentionally learned that the Art teacher, \cChupAvenger{}, is having romantic problems of \cChupAvenger{\their} own. It seems that the love of \cChupAvenger{\their} life, \cHeadScientist{}, has forgotten them! Naturally, you are cautious about approaching the situation, since \cChupAvenger{} might not want help from a student and it all begs the question of what \cHeadScientist{} did to lose part of \cHeadScientist{\their} memories. But on the other hand, how cool would it be to help these two get back together?

So this weekend is going to be busy. You have a lot of decisions to make about your own future, the future of your nation to protect, and the future of your friends to help build. Which Goddess will you choose to serve? Will \cPresident{} or \cChupAvenger{} find romance? And will you manage to break the bad luck curse without being forced to acquiesce to your \pFarm{} family's demands?

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Pick whether you will follow the path of \cEbb{\full}, path of \cFlow{\full}, or attempt the very difficult path of Balance.
	\item Help secretly resurrect the \cEbb{} avatar. Without it, you could not pick to follow \cEbb{}'s path.
	\item Deal with the bad luck curse. Find a way to break it (knowing who cast it would help). Then decide whether you are going to return to your extended family in \pFarm{}.
	\item Help \cPresident{} out with \cPresident{\their} investigations, and if you can get \cPresident{\them} to put work aside for a minute, help \cPresident{\them} approach \cHeir{} and/or \cChupStudent{} as potential romantic partners.
	\item Help \cChupAvenger{} out with getting \cHeadScientist{} to regain \cHeadScientist{\their} memories of \cChupAvenger{}.
	\item Hang out with \cBunker{} and do your best to let you assist \cBunker{\them} in maintaining the bunkers.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are graduating this year.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cPresident{}} Your best friend. Accomplished and confident - yet sometimes you wonder if \cPresident{\they} would be able to accomplish anything without your help.
	\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} A fellow initiate of the Goddesses. Great for late night chats about the meaning of life.
	\contact{\cChupAvenger{}} A teacher whose love has forgotten \cChupAvenger{\them}.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} The chief engineer who designed the bunkers that protect people at the school as the storm intensifies. You are so excited to study with them during the annual check of the bunkers.
