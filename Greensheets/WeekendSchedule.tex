\name{\gWeekendSchedule{}}

Below is the full event schedule, including both in game and out of game events as of 05May2021. \textbf{While there are a number of activities scheduled throughout the weekend, there is also lots of time that is unstructured, for characters to run around and do whatever they judge fit.} Not all of the structured activities are required either, but they can be good places to find people and learn things.

This schedule is subject to change between now and game start as in and out of game needs mandate. We will have a final copy of the schedule at game, which will supersede this one if any changes are made.

%%%%%%%% Meal times: 8 am, 12 pm, 5:30 pm

For workshops on Friday afternoon, you should plan the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pack a jacket and sunscreen in an easily accessible place, we will be outside the whole time, and you may want to grab one or both.
	\item Bring camp chairs or similar if you have them, workshops and orientation are almost 4 hours, and that is a very long time to be on your feet. Even if you don’t need them, or need them the whole time, someone else may benefit greatly from borrowing them.
\end{itemize}
