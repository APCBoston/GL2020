\name{\cInterpol{}}

You are \cInterpol{\full} (\cInterpol{\they}/\cInterpol{\them}), a 32 year old secret agent who is glad to be back in the field. You are a high ranking member of the Order of the Black Crocus, under cover at the \pSchool{} as the Combat teacher. Your current, crucial mission is to infiltrate the \pGoaties{} and stop their plot. This would be easier if you didn't find yourself agreeing with the \pGoaties{} more often than not.

You know their words are propaganda, but even so, they're hard to resist. They speak about how \cFarmGod{} has forsaken the common people, and you're not sure you disagree. Too often, the prayers of the common people go unanswered, while the nobility seem to receive a glut of divine favor, making it very clear that the system is out of balance. Not that balance is everything (that's a very \pShip{} belief), but surely a \cFarmGod{\God} owes something to all of \cFarmGod{\their} followers---not just the ones that can afford gold for tithing instead of copper. The \pGoaties{} seem to be offering a nearly perfect solution---true equity for all people. Such a lofty ambition seems a little\ldots{}too perfect---and the group has been rumored to have its fingers in a \emph{lot} of shady business. But still, that's why you are here---to find out if it really is too good to be true.

In your early years, you were a moderately powerful magic user from a moderately powerful family â€” nothing particularly special. You loved (and still love) music, and even briefly considered joining the Priesthood for the monopoly they hold on the musical art of healing magic. Ultimately, it was that very monopoly that changed your mind---while you still revered music as something sacred, you couldn't help but feel that if healing magic was available to the masses, it would be better for everyone. You didn't want to be part of a system that kept such a basic human need in its own tightly clenched fist. Ah, the idealism of youth. So instead, you followed the path of least resistance, working hard in school and the game of courtly intrigue. An unexpected twist came when you were recruited by the Order of the Black Crocus, a secret international law enforcement entity with jurisdiction across all three nations. Your questioning of the status quo and hope for a more just world no doubt helped, as the Order frequently operated outside the strict letter of the law in favor of pragmatism and justice. Given access to equipment and information, you accomplished a number of rather remarkable things. Single handedly saving an orphanage and shutting down an organized crime ring---it was all in a day's work for you. But you were slightly too effective for your own good. Your superiors pulled you off of field work much too soon, and stuck you behind a desk managing other agents.

But then the war happened, and the Order of the Black Crocus, previously an international organization, splintered. Greatly reduced in personnel and resources, you've struggled somewhat since to find direction. To your chagrin, direction was imposed on you when the Spymaster of the Children of the Sun absorbed the local remnants of the Order of the Black Crocus into their own spy network. You are now expected to collect secrets on the other nations and report them to the Spymaster. Fortunately, the Spymaster is also concerned about the rising threat of a radical religious cult known as the \pGoaties{}, a clear and present danger to the current power structure. With no one better suited to the task of intelligence gathering and your roster as diminished as it was, you managed to assign yourself the field position on this case. All the threads seemed to be leading towards the College of the Gods, so four years ago you forged the papers you'd need to infiltrate the school as a magical combat teacher.

You soon found that you aren't as rusty as you feared. It quickly became clear that the \pGoaties{} are quite active at the school. You've got some pretty good leads on infiltrating the \pGoaties{}, although it took a few years. This group is good at covering their tracks. Very good. You are 90 percent sure that \cChupInventor{\full}, the Political Science teacher, is involved at a very high level. You aren't as sure about \cChupSecond{\full}, or \cWildCard{\full}---those are more of a toss up. They are both definitely up to \emph{something}, but you don't know what exactly. You have also figured out that the group's symbol is a four-leaf clover. Now that you have some leads, it's time to take the dangerous but necessary step of actually infiltrating the \pGoaties{}.

To combat the fact that you have no history with the group up to this point, you've prepared yourself to pose as an Avenger. An Avenger is an obscure concept, talked about only in the quietest whispers---a person who kills on behalf of the God \cGenesis{} and is forgotten by others instead of forgetting themselves. Your cover story is that you have been killing so many targets for the group that even the group's members have forgotten you---and, conveniently, you're just one assassination away from being forgotten by existence entirely, and are understandably reluctant to take that last step.

With this cover, you hope that you can determine the true intentions of the \pGoaties{}, and fast. Your sources suggest they are planning something big for this weekend. If they mean to elevate \cGenesis{} to the same rank as the other Patron Deties as a \cGenesis{\Deity} of Luck on the side the common folk, that's something you can get behind. You may even be willing to risk your career to let it slide or even help them. But if they are up to something else---assassinating heads of government, destroying priceless artifacts at the \pSchool{}, or doing something that would make life harder for the masses---that, you cannot allow. If you find this to be the case, you must bring them back to the \pFarm{} for interrogation. Dead people don't talk, and leads released into the custody of other nations have a distressing tendency to escape before you get your turn. If you are unable to capture the Followers of Genesis, then foiling any plans they have that would harm the masses and successfully infiltrating the group so you are a properly embedded double agent will suffice.

One of the scenarios that scares you the most this weekend is someone absconding with or misusing one of the six Relics, the most likely culprits being the Followers of Genesis. Each one is powerful and dangerous in its own right, and if at least three of them aren't on hand for the Ritual to Control the Storm, the destruction could be catastrophic. It is therefore of paramount importance that the Relics stay present, attuned, and intact. The \iScythe{} especially is a potent weapon, capable of killing almost any entity that meets its blade, no matter how powerful.

Additionally, you know that if someone wanted to interfere with the Time of Deciding, another vulnerable point is the Bunkers that protect those who remain at the school from the Storm Surges. If the Bunkers were to be damaged, it would jeopardize the lives of all who remain on campus, and the very world if they were to succumb to the Storm before completing the ritual to direct it. Therefore, you intend to do what you can to keep an eye on the Bunkers, and help their designer, \cBunker{\full}, maintain them this weekend.

In the course of your investigations here at the \pSc{}, you intercepted a rather personal letter addressed to \cLibrarian{\full}, ostensibly from \cLibrarian{\their} parents. The letter made reference to the fact that \cLibrarian{} had killed a pirate in order to protect their grandparents. If true, that would make \cLibrarian{} an amnesiac. This theory DOES line up with \cLibrarian{\their} apparent spate of odd behavior as of late, and when you asked \cLibrarian{\them} point blank, \cLibrarian{\they} admitted to having lost \cLibrarian{\their} memories. \cLibrarian{} has been a friend and mentor of yours ever since you arrived at the school, so this places you in an awkward position. Amnesiacs are often discriminated against as murderers (which, they are, but nuances often get lost in the court of public opinion). Should you keep this information to yourself and help cover for \cLibrarian{\them}, knowing that sooner or later someone is probably going to find out, landing you both in trouble? Or should you try and get out ahead of it, reveal the reason for the amnesia in the hopes that Principal \cPrincipal{\full} and the authorities will grant clemency? So far you have been helping cover for \cLibrarian{\them}, but you know you are probably just delaying the inevitable. Moreover, what should you do with the letter, and should you tell \cLibrarian{} what you know? You broke the seal in order to read it, which means if you return it now, \cLibrarian{} will know it was tampered with. But if you don't return it, \cLibrarian{\they} is likely to remain in the dark about why \cLibrarian{\they} \cLibrarian{\have} amnesia. You are no stranger to moral quandaries, but this is a tough one.

Posing as a teacher has come with its own set of challenges. You knew being a teacher was hard work, but you weren't prepared for the kids to require so much reassurance and guidance. You have even found yourself with a favorite student, \cDisney{\full}. \cDisney{} is just so\ldots{}pure and innocent, full of idealism and hope for a better world. \cDisney{\They} reminds you of yourself when you were younger, and you intend to support \cDisney{\them} however you can. One way of doing so is to convince the \pTech{} teachers and the \pFarm{} advisors to rank \cDisney{} highest for voting authority to direct the Storm. \cDisney{} is one of the few people you would trust to make a truly selfless decision about where to send the Storm, and just try to do whatever will serve the common good. Another student who has garnered your special attention, though for entirely different reasons, is \cAdopted{\full}. \cAdopted{} struggles greatly in your class, and is terrified of combat. You continue to help \cAdopted{\them} as much as you can, and believe \cAdopted{\they} hold great potential if \cAdopted{\they} can learn to overcome \cAdopted{\their} fears. And then there is \cPirateChild{\full}, a student who is clearly also a thief, and a good one at that. Good enough to get in and out of \cChupInventor{}'s office undetected---something even you have yet to manage. Maybe \cPirateChild{} could be persuaded to help you somehow in your investigations? And then there is the strange behavior of one \pFarm{} student named \cLibAssist{\full}. You're not sure why, but you're pretty sure that \cLibAssist{\they}'ve been keeping an eye on you---and you're getting definite shady vibes. You should find out what \cLibAssist{\they} know\cLibAssist{\plural} and find a way to keep it from getting out if \cLibAssist{} somehow know\cLibAssist{\plural} something important. No way are you letting someone barely half your age get the better of you.

You've also made friends in your time here, such as the Music teacher, \cMusic{\full}. While \cMusic{\theyare}n't a \cMusic{\cleric} \cMusic{\themself}, \cMusic{\they} understand\cMusic{\plural} music's value and its place in religion. \cMusic{\They} \cMusic{\have} a special dispensation from the Church to teach music even though \cMusic{\theyare} not a Cleric. The two of you have bonded over your shared reverence for music. You're happy to help \cMusic{\them} if they need something, or just be a listening ear.

This will be a busy weekend. Not only do you need to infiltrate a cult (and decide what to do once you're there), you also need to keep your own secrets under wraps. It will be a lot to handle---but it's nothing you're not used to. You're the best of the best, and you intend to prove it.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Infiltrate and assess the true intentions of the \pGoaties{}. Stop their plan if you deem it unjust, and capture the group members to bring home for interrogation if you can.
	\item Keep the Relics safe; they are needed for the Ritual to control the Storm, and each one could prove incredibly dangerous in the wrong hands.
	\item Help \cBunker{} maintain the Bunkers that protect against the Storm.
	\item Help your favorite student, \cDisney{}, win the most voting authority to direct the Storm Surges.
\item Decide what to do about your friend \cLibrarian{}'s amnesia, and the letter you intercepted explaining the reason for it.
	\item Support anyone trying to make magical healing more readily available.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are the magical combat teacher at the College of the Gods.
	\item You are relatively new to the school, having taught here for only 4 years. You were too junior 3 years ago to be selected to stay for the Time of Deciding, but this year you made damn sure of it.
	\item International espionage is a thriving trade these days, and given the pivotal events happening this weekend, you would not be at all surprised if spies from all three nations are present.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} The Political Science teacher, who you haven't had much contact with---but are 90 percent sure is a high ranking member of the \pGoaties{}. Likely your best way into the group.
\contact{\cWildCard{}} An advisor who you know little about. Your sources weren't certain, but also a possible member of the \pGoaties{}.
	\contact{\cChupSecond{}} The Economics teacher, relatively isolated from the other teachers. Your sources weren't certain, but also a possible member of the \pGoaties{}
	\contact{\cLibrarian{}} The Librarian, a reliable person until \cLibrarian{\they} became an amnesiac, ostensibly for killing a pirate in self defense. You consider \cLibrarian{\them} a friend and mentor and are unsure what to do with this information\ldots{}
	\contact{\cMusic{}} Your teacher friend who you share your love of music with.
	\contact{\cAdopted{}} The student who struggles the most in your magical combat class. You believe \cAdopted{\they} hold great potential, though.
	\contact{\cDisney{}} Your favorite student, a hopeless idealist who reminds you of your younger self.
\end{contacts}
