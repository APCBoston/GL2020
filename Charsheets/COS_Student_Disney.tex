%% Stephanie AKA COS Student Disney

You are \cDisney{} (\cDisney{\they}/\cDisney{\them}), and 18 years old. Well… technically 218, but you were asleep for most of that. You are a first year student at \pSchool{} and you grew up in \pFarm{} two centuries ago. As you have endured 200 years of enchanted sleep and only awoke nine months ago, the world is strange to you.  Common people have access to technomagical creations, the upper class walk around in clothing woven with magic, and traveling “circuses” from \pTech{} share art and music freely amongst the \pFarmers{}.

You hold a deadly secret you would only share with those you trust, but you’ve begun to make friends in your short time at \pSchool{}. You have always considered yourself something of an idealist and dreamer, which is what led you to the Priesthood in the first place.  When you were awakened, and subsequently invited to attend \pSchool{}, you hoped that the additional learning would allow you to both find your own place in this modern world and help others in the process.

You’d been studying to enter the Priesthood and were almost ready to formally do so when your mentor \cDisneyMentor{} and \cDisneyMentor{\their} sect attempted the most magnificent feat ever embarked upon by humankind.  Unfortunately, a rival sect of the Priesthood saw the attempt to actually reach the Realm of the Gods as Heresy.  They broke into the temple where the Ritual was being attempted just in time to stop it, killing all the Priests therein.  At the last moment, \cDisneyMentor{} hid you in the Crypt below the Temple, lying in a sleep like death, where you remained for 200 years.  You were awoken by \cWildCard{}, who had worked for years to unravel a puzzle that eventually led \cWildCard{\them} to you. \cWildCard{} gave you your first introduction to the present, and you are eternally grateful. The only item you have left from your earlier life is a locket that was given to you for safekeeping by \cDisneyMentor{}, which shines with the light of \cFarmGod{} when you open it. You treasure it, and hope to find out what its specific religious significance is without it being reclaimed by the Priesthood.

A number of things are different now than they were so long ago, but most concerning to you beyond the current war is the absence of the Giant Hummingbirds, Avatars of \cFarmGod{}, which were so common in your time. The Hummingbirds used to be a cornerstone of daily life, appearing with messages of hope, faith, and inspiration to anyone who needed them. While you are perplexed at their current scarcity, you are even more alarmed by the fact that nobody seems to think this is unusual, especially given that the nations are currently at war. Of course the wars and great successes and failures of mortals influence the power of the gods, and the success of their divine labors. You are determined to discover why \cFarmGod{}’s messengers have abandoned your people in what is clearly a time of great need.

As a perhaps more immediate concern, your friend \cPirateChild{} has found a Dragon’s egg, and (perhaps misguidedly) smuggled it into the school to give to you as an early present for your birthday. You are touched by the gesture\ldots if a little troubled by the practicalities. You aren’t sure \cPirateChild{} really thought this through in terms of what you should do with such a creature in the long term, but you know \cPirateChild{\they} meant well. 

At first, everything was going smoothly, and you’d gotten \cAdopted{} to cast an enchantment to disguise the egg as an innocuous box - but of course, the little creature hatched at the worst possible time. Now you have a smart, adorable, ravenously hungry little baby dragon to keep hidden and fed. And to top it off, the poor thing seems to be sick, and keeps sneezing! You are determined to preserve this precious, albeit someday terrifying, creature, because the Dragons, also known as Sea Serpents, are the Avatars of \cShipGod{}. And the poor thing has no family, much like yourself\ldots And because it is so, so sweet. You think you could make it through this current predicament with a little luck, ingenuity\ldots and maybe another enchantment from your friend \cAdopted{}?

You’ve also been asked a favor by \cWildCard{}, who is apparently looking for information on the existence of a Black Market. \cWildCard{\they} think\cWildCard{\plural} that \cBunker{} might have important information about it, and \cWildCard{\they} wants you to sneak into \cBunker{}’s office and steal paperwork from a briefcase. Normally you wouldn’t consider doing such a thing, but you feel you owe a debt to \cWildCard{} for saving you from what could easily have been a permanent internment in the Crypt, and you’re sure \cWildCard{\they} won’t misuse the information.

You also know that \cWildCard{}, probably among other far less worthy individuals, would like to know more about the ill-fated Ritual that was being cast to gain entry to the Realm of Gods. While you would never reveal this information if you thought anyone would try to repeat the Ritual that led to the deaths of all those at your Temple, \cWildCard is the person you trust most? Unfortunately, your memories of the Ritual itself are scattered, at best. You’ve tried and tried to remember, but have come up empty, even with the great emotional support of your other good friend, \cTechStar{}. If only he got along better with \cWildCard{}!

Speaking of \cTechStar{}, you recently overheard someone suspicious talking on the other side of a closed door. The mutterings were indistinct, but you’re certain you heard them say something about either getting control of his creation, the VidCom technology, or preventing it from getting out - no matter the cost. The voice - feminine, you are pretty sure? - sounded serious. Deadly serious. Just what has he gotten himself into?  Like yourself, \cTechStar{\they} \cTechStar{\are} an idealist, and genuinely wants to help others with \cTechStar{\their} technology - so whoever it is is definitely a bad person.

Well, there are mysteries to unravel, and friends to help, as well as your first time helping to prepare the all important Ritual to direct the Storm, the main event of the weekend.  As a budding \cDisney{\Clergy}, you are thrilled to be included in this vital work, and despite the many other priorities on your plate, you feel this is the most vitally important of all. Your contribution and subsequent vote will help, or harm, more people than you ever dreamed possible, and helping others is at the very core of your being. This is the most important weekend of your new modern life, and you can just feel that it is going to work out perfectly. You’ll make sure of it!
