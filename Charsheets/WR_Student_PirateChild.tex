\name{\cPirateChild{}}

You are pretending to be \cPirateChild{\full} (\cPirateChild{\they}/\cPirateChild{\them}), and 18 years old. That's not your real identity, though. You are really a \pShippie{} pirate hailing from Silent Fog ship in the 8th Fleet, and your mission here has been years in the making. You were determined to stick it to ``civilized society'' and had no intention of actually sticking around the school, but you may have accidentally made some friends here that make your mission\ldots{} more complicated.

You grew up on the high seas, and your loyalty lies first with your crew on the Silent Fog and second with your seafaring nation's people, if not with her laws. The Silent Fog is a notorious pirate ship, terrorizing the coast of the \pFarm{} well beyond the normal extortion racket. They are your family, and you are a good pirate, and a damn fine pickpocket. And if your fear of fire is a little stronger than normal for a pirate, no one makes a big deal of it. You weren't born on the Silent Fog, though. One of her former crew brought you to the ship, who in turn passed you off to another ship, the Oyster Bay of 12th Fleet. You spent your first 13 years on the Oyster Bay before moving back to the Silent Fog in a spike of curiosity about where you originally came from. But the crew of the Silent Fog at the time didn't know, and you fit right in, so you stayed. The crew-member who had brought you aboard when you were a baby was away on a secret mission long in the making, one which you now get to be a part of.

At the \pSchool{} is housed the ``\iNet{}''. This Net is a Relic that according to legend was built by artisans from all 12 fleets under the direction of the Goddesses themselves. And while it can certainly be used to in the rituals here at the \pSc{}, and to entangle someone, it can also be used to incredible effect by an individual ship. If the Silent Fog could get the Net aboard, it would be able to control the waters in the \pWod{} - it would be uncatchable. Your job is to steal the \iNet{}, still attuned to the \pShip{}, but without it being used for the ritual, and bring it home. 

You don't have to do this alone -- the former crew member is here. Somewhere. Their coded messages say so. But it was agreed upon, long before you could read those codes, that it was best to wait until the last minute for you to make contact. This is the last minute, and you need to find someone who will respond to the phrase, ``The Waters untouched are not abandoned,'' with, ``by those brave enough chart the course.'' The two of you will then need to devise a way to steal the \iNet{} and get it home. You'll only get one shot at this as their cover will be blown after this – so make it count, and make sure the two of you get home safely. The undercover pirate has to be one of the teachers. But which one? Is it one of the \pShip{} teachers, or are they deeper undercover, pretending to be from one of the other nations?

Maybe it is just the stress of your mission, but your dreams have been restless of late. The past three nights you've had dreams about the parent who gave you up all those 17 years ago. Last night, the message was most emphatic — you are supposed to find them. Apparently they will be at the \pSc{} this weekend. You would probably have ignored the dream, except that it had divine weight behind it. Too bad the deity couldn't be bothered to reveal themself. Still, when a Deity says climb the rigging, you climb first and ask ``how high?'' later. The pirate who is here undercover is the self-same one who brought you to the Silent Fog all those years ago. They have to know something about who gave you to them, so you can start your investigation there. Just one more reason to find your undercover contact as soon as possible. 

But now you're getting ahead of yourself. When your mysterious crew-mate wrote to the ship that they would need a second agent to liberate the \iNet{}, there was somewhat of a scramble to find a way to get a student into the school. It was great luck that you hit upon \cWildCard{\full} as a contact. \cWildCard{\Theyare} a noble\cWildCard{\person} of the \pFarm{}, with holdings on the coast. During one of the Silent Fog's visits to collect protection money, \cWildCard{} approached you with a most unusual offer. \cWildCard{\They} offered to bankroll your campaign bid to the \pSchool{}, if you agreed to pretend to be friends with \cDisney{\full}, some \cDisney{\kid} \cWildCard{\they} \cWildCard{\were} taking an interest in. Apparently, the \cDisney{\kid} has some ancient and forbidden knowledge about how to reach the Divine Realm or something like that. Sounds like fun to you! Maybe it will lead to treasure, and you can get a cut of the reward! Regardless, that solved the problem of getting you into the school without suspicion. Come to think of it, though, \cWildCard{} now knows you are a pirate, and therefore has blackmail on you. Better hope that doesn't come back to bite you\ldots{}

Conning a clueless landlubber all seemed well and good, until you arrived at the \pSchool{} and actually met \cDisney{}. Pretending to be friends very quickly melted into being \emph{actual} friends. \cDisney{\They} \cDisney{\were} asleep for 2 centuries - everyone \cDisney{\they} knew and loved are gone. You aren't sentimental or anything, but the two of you just really hit it off. \cDisney{\They} \cDisney{\have} even told you a little about what happened to \cDisney{\them} before \cDisney{\they} \cDisney{\were} put to sleep. You know you should be fishing for the information \cWildCard{} wants, but what if it ends up hurting \cDisney{}? What if \cDisney{\they} stop\cDisney{\plural} wanting to be your friend? One of \cDisney{}'s other friends is  \cTechStar{\full}, and \cTechStar{\theyare} like your complete opposite. The two of you can't agree on anything, including \cWildCard{}. For some reason, \cTechStar{} detests \cWildCard{}, and would certainly try to stop \cDisney{} from telling you things if \cTechStar{\they} knew they were for \cWildCard{}. As far as you're concerned, blackmail and extortion are just business. It's not a big deal unless \cWildCard{} actually blows your cover – until then, you mostly just have respect for the position \cWildCard{\they} managed to put you in.

You and \cDisney{} get along so well that when you learned it was going to be \cDisney{}'s birthday this Sunday, you knew you had to do something big. At first the idea seemed ridiculous and over the top. But the more you thought about it, the more enamored of it you became. You snuck a sea serpent egg into the \pSc{} with you after the last school break. Your patience ran out though, and you showed it to \cDisney{} early. Unfortunately, \cDisney{\they} \cDisney{\were}n't as keen on the idea as you, pointing out things like how big sea serpents get. That is definitely a problem, but one to solve\ldots{} later. With the help of another mutual friend, \cAdopted{\full}, the two of you disguised the egg as a stuffed animal while you tried to figure out what to do. And now that it's hatched, the disguise spell from \cAdopted{} has broken, and the precious little thing needs to be taken care of.  It's not like it would have made a very convincing stuffed animal when it keeps wiggling and sneezing, anyway. Hmm, you hope it isn't sick\ldots{} And who knew they ate so much? (For now you and your friends have hidden the sea serpent in a hidden compartment behind one of the bookshelves in the student lounge.) Maybe trying to gift your friend a wild creature that will grow up into a ravenous monster wasn't the best idea. Still, it would be a shame to have the cute little thing taken away, and \cDisney{} does seem very attached to it now that it's hatched. Your biggest concern is the clerics. The Church of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{} has a complicated relationship with sea serpents, as the Avatars of the Goddesses manifest in the serpents, but full grown serpents are incredibly dangerous. And the clerics and their initiates have been talking a lot about Avatars in hushed tones recently\ldots{} Maybe you can work with \cTechStar{} to throw a surprise party for \cDisney{} to make up for all the stress of keeping the sea serpent hidden? You will probably need \cAdopted{} to mediate between the two of you though.

Maintaining your cover is hard, especially with so many excellent things to steal. You were always an expert pickpocket, having learned from the best, and the school is just full of deep pockets and valuable trinkets that aren't nailed down. You've even managed to steal small things from some of the teachers' offices. \cChupInventor{\full} was the hardest. Why \cChupInventor{\does} \cChupInventor{\they} have so much security on \cChupInventor{\their} office anyway? As for what to do with the stolen items, you've heard there is a black market at the school — the perfect place to fence them, and see if there is any interesting contraband for sale while you're at it! You just need to find out who to talk to. Another item that has piqued your interest for potential theft of late has been the voting stones for the Ritual to Control the Storm. They are supposed to be incredibly hard to steal – something about their magic. You'd really enjoy the challenge of stealing one from somebody, both to prove that you can and to improve the odds of sending the Storm somewhere other than the \pShip{}.

Of course, you could always get the most votes to direct the Storm the boring way. You mostly just want to be a pain in the ass to the stuck-up stuck up 1st Fleet kids (\cPresident{\full} and \cInitiate{\full}), but also imagine how stupid everyone would feel if they found out a pirate won the most votes? Even if they didn't stop hating pirates and reconsider their classist world view, it would at least make them look foolish.

Speaking of foolish, you may have been had too. \cChupLeader{\full} looks awfully familiar. A few years back, \cHeadDiplomat{\full} was visiting 8th fleet with \cHeadDiplomat{\their} fancy talk about how pirates should recant their ways. You and the rest of the Silent Fog thought it might be big money to capture \cHeadDiplomat{} and hold \cHeadDiplomat{\them} for ransom. Things\ldots{} didn't exactly go to plan. You were quite worried when you saw that \cHeadDiplomat{} was supposed to lead the \pShip{} delegation this weekend, and breathed quite the sigh of relief when this morning you found out \cHeadDiplomat{} was super sick and had to stay home. But it seems \cHeadDiplomat{\their} secretary \cChupLeader{}, who had been along on that trip \textbf{is} coming, and \cChupLeader{\they} might recognize you. You're gonna have to think of some way to contain that.

Lastly, there is the matter of the Ceremony of Excellence. Those stuck-up 1st Fleet kids are graduating, but that doesn't mean they have to be the ones to give the speech — any student can do it. But you don't particularly want to hear from \cWarlordDaughter{\full} either. \cWarlordDaughter{\Their} \cLoud{\parent}, \cLoud{\full}, is the one leading the war effort. No one has suffered from the curses and trebuchets of the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} more than the pirates and others left on the margins of the \pShip{} society. \cWarlordDaughter{} is as bad as any of them. By process of elimination, that leaves you to give the speech. All you have to do is convince \cMusic{\full} that you are the best choice. Not that public speaking is your favorite, but it would be glorious to have a platform to give a lot of people a piece of your mind, both within the \pShippies{} and beyond.

This weekend will be a high stakes gamble, but if it pays off, you and the rest of the Silent Fog will be set for life. You just have to figure out if you are ready to say goodbye to all of your new friends, and discover the identity of your birth parent.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Find the undercover pirate, help them steal the properly attuned ``\iNet{}'', and bring both the pirate and the net home with you. Don't let the \iNet{} be used in the ritual. Avoid blowing either of your covers until the last possible second.
	\item Find the parent that gave you up as a baby. Step one is finding the undercover pirate, who should know where to start looking.
	\item Keep the sea serpent a secret – more importantly, take care of it and keep it alive, as it would be really awkward if the birthday gift for your friend were to die.
	\item Get the information \cWildCard{} wants from \cDisney{}, if you decide it's worth the risk to your friendship.
	\item Get chosen to give the student speech at the Ceremony of Excellence. You can figure out what to actually say later.
	\item Convince the \pFarm{} teachers and \pShip{} advisors to rank you the highest for voting authority to direct the Storm. Then, use that authority to make sure the Storm doesn't get sent to the \pShip{}.
	\item Steal at least one voting stone, just to prove that you can. While you're at it, see if there is anything else valuable you can steal, or buy on the black market. 
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are planning to find the undercover pirate by asking around using the phrase: ``The Waters untouched are not abandoned.'’ You expect the following response from the right person: ``by those brave enough chart the course.'' You will have to be careful though, many people do not like pirates, or even outright hate them. If the wrong person somehow knew the code phrases, or overheard you, it could blow everything.
	\item You have a strong phobia of fire, particularly large open flames, but torches and even candles make you nervous.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cWildCard{}} The \pFarm{} noble\cWildCard{\person} who enabled your attendance at the \pSchool{} in exchange for an agreement to pretend to be \cDisney{}'s friend once you got here. \cWildCard{\They} want\cWildCard{\plural} you to get \cDisney{} to share some ancient, forbidden knowledge about the Realm of the Gods. Maybe you should have paid better attention to exactly what \cWildCard{} wanted\ldots{}
	\contact{\cDisney{}} You were originally supposed to try to be \cDisney{\their} friend (and pretend if you had to), but you soon became actual friends.
	\contact{\cAdopted{}} Another friend who is helping you hide the sea serpent you brought \cDisney{} for \cDisney{\their} birthday.
	\contact{\cTechStar{}} Another friend of \cDisney{}'s, and supposedly some sort of technical genius from the \pTech{}. The two of you don't get along.
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} A teacher from the \pTech{} with a suspicious amount of security on \cChupInventor{\their} office.
\contact{\cChupLeader{}} Uh oh – you recognize this \cChupLeader{\pal}. Hopefully \cChupLeader{\they} \cChupLeader{\does}n't recognize you!
\end{contacts}
