To be a Cleric of \cTechGod{} is to be a pillar of stability for the people of the \pTech{}. The \pTech{} follow \cTechGod{}, the \cTechGod{\Deity} of Knowledge and Inspiration.  \cTechGod{}'s Avatars are Beetles, who walk through ink and leave runes on paper, which scholars among the clergy study.  

\section*{A Cleric's Powers and Responsibilities}
The Temple strictly regulates use of magic and places limitations on technology.  They do this in the interest of maintaining the wellbeing,  freedom, and equality of all people.  

High ranking Clerics of \cTechGod{} have the ability to imbue a new piece of technology with magic, thus making it function. They also have the ability to authorize a design to be sent to production in order to make the technology available to the people of \pTech{}. Lower ranking Clerics have the power to diagnose and repair broken things. Much of their magical energy is directed toward imbuing the technology coming off production lines. Like all Clerics, \cTechGod{}'s Clerics can provide physical and mental healing, though often not as well as a \pFarm{} Cleric, well versed in the musical healing arts.

\subsection*{Crimes and Punishment}
\cTechGod{} punishes the following crimes among \cTechGod{\their} followers:  Murder, kidnapping, major Intellectual Property theft, and Scam artistry are punished with memory loss.  Unregulated magical enchantment of technology is punished by lifetime inability to use tech or magic.  Smaller crimes lead to temporary memory loss, or temporary tech ban, or a mark on the forehead that brings social shame. The temple is expected to keep an eye out for these things, and draw \cTechGod{}'s attention when such infractions occur.

\subsection*{Temple History and Structure}
The temple was founded at the beginning of times, at the birth of the Nation, by the Grace of \cTechGod{}. From the original Circle of Five, the Temple has grown to include many Clerics who serve all over the \pTech{}.

The current Circle of Five are the highest Officers of the Temple. They govern according to a written conscriptus of religious laws. A series of middle managers divide up the country into increasingly smaller areas, until individual Clerics are able to work directly with up to a few dozen of \cTechGod{}'s followers under the supportive umbrella of the Temple at large.

%%Kero gave the Temple jurisdiction over determining what tech gets enabled.  Kero's goal was to ensure that the tech benefitted her people and encouraged peace, unity, equality, and innovation.  The Temple has gradually moved away from this and towards capitalism and elitism.  Black is convinced he is doing Kero's will, but he's super wrong.  Arike is more in line with the will of Kero.
