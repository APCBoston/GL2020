\name{\cHeir{}}

You are \cHeir{\full} (\cHeir{\they}/\cHeir{\them}), and 21 years old.  It's your third and final year at the \pSchool{} - which means that this is your last chance, for so many things.  As the reluctant Heir to the elite \cHeir{\formal} family, a family with an exclusive Council seat and a tech and manufacturing empire, your future is all but written in stone, whether you like it or not. At least, that's what they think! You've got a plan they'll all hate that will earn you your freedom, and probably save the company from your own disinterest. You have no desire to run the family business, and would rather enjoy your future in freedom, even if you aren't entirely sure what you'd do with it.

Of course, you wouldn't be the \cHeir{\formal} Heir if your older \cHeirSibling{\sibling}, \cHeirSibling{\full}, was still alive. \cHeirSibling{\They} \cHeirSibling{\were} a student at the \pSchool{} six years ago, and died under mysterious circumstances along with \cHeirSibling{\their} best friend, \cKidScientist{\full}, and ten other students right after voting to direct the Storm – the Storm that broke the treaty between the three nations by being sent to the \pShip{} out of turn. Even though the culprits were never found, you are sure that the students were murdered to cover up some conspiracy. The rest of the world may be content to sweep it under the rug, but you will not leave this school without discovering what really happened to your \cHeirSibling{\sibling} and bringing \cHeirSibling{\their} murderer(s) to justice. The one(s) responsible will most likely be here again at this crucial juncture, and you're not going to let them get away \emph{this} time. You and your friend \cPresident{\full} have investigated as much as you could, and made every preparation to be ready to do the ritual with \iMirror{} once you get your hands on it.

But even if you can find justice for \cHeirSibling{}, the succession to the Faledon empire still falls to you. It is a tangled web that you're trying to escape, but if you take it apart piece by piece, you should be able to manage it all. The most crucial part of the puzzle is getting out of your position as Heir to the \cHeir{\formal} family business, and all that goes with it. Apparently, a distant ancestor of yours wanted to make REALLY sure that there would never be competition for, or absence of, a \cHeir{\formal} Heir, and so set up a generation-spanning blood magic ritual – no doubt purchased illegally from some cursemaker in the \pFarm{} – as insurance. That spell ensures that the oldest child, the Heir, was stuck with the job, and that any siblings are made too magically loyal to the Heir to conspire to eliminate them for the position even if they'd otherwise want to. Happily for you, they neglected to make the Heir magically loyal to the family in the same way. Their arrogant assumption was that any risk to the Heir would come from the outside, and that the compulsory loyalty of their siblings would help protect them. It never occurred to them that the Heir themself would wish to orchestrate their removal. Until \cHeirSibling{}'s death, you were fiercely loyal to the Faledons, and to supporting \cHeirSibling{} in all things. You knew \cHeirSibling{\they} \cHeirSibling{\were} dead the instant it happened – you felt the magical compulsion to loyalty fade as the Heirship passed to you.

Your family would like you to believe it's impossible to escape this bond - but through extensive research, you've discovered a way. You can complete a modified version of an obscure ritual involving blood magic (``oh, the horror!''). The ritual you developed will cause a second person to become metaphysically indistinguishable from yourself - you will both equally be the one true heir. Luckily, the ``who'' part of this is easy!  Your best friend \cAmbition{\full} would love nothing more than to shoulder the burden, and to wield the power that you're so desperate to escape. Given your supreme disinterest and \cAmbition{\their} brains, you're sure \cAmbition{\they} will do a much better job of leading the family and the business.  

Since your family won't approve, and blood magic is deeply frowned upon in both your homeland and the \pFarm{} (where such magic originates), you'll need to be sneaky about it. That will be especially complicated this weekend, since \cDiplomat{\full} will be here and your \cFaledonParent{\parent} has written to tell you \cDiplomat{\they} will be conferring the family's Heir Seal (signet ring) upon you. Only one Seal is crafted per generation, and it is permanently bound to the Heir when it is conferred. You need to get the blood ritual with \cAmbition{} completed before \cDiplomat{} can catch you for the Seal ritual, because once that happens it will be too late to trade places. You haven't seen \cDiplomat{} much since you started college, but you're sure \cDiplomat{\they}'ll be a pain about everything. 

All of which means that this weekend is your last and best chance to escape the Heirship. You'll need to make sure the transfer of power from you to \cAmbition{} is complete not just magically, but socially, by ensuring \cAmbition{\they} is set up as well as possible for future success as the Heir. Part of that means making sure that \cAmbition{\they} win\cAmbition{\plural} the highest voting authority in the Ritual to Control the Storm instead of you, which will impress your family. If \cAmbition{} had some flashy new invention to bring to the family to mass produce, that certainly wouldn't hurt either. The VidCom devices that \cTechStar{\full} created would have been an ideal choice if the council (which includes the head of the \cHeir{\formal} family) hadn't voted to keep this valuable resource strictly for the war effort. No, you'll have to find something else. Maybe you could look beyond the borders of the \pTech{} and see if one of the \pShippie{} or \pFarm{} students has created something worthy of the \cHeir{\formal}s?

It's alarming, and you suppose typical of your family's meddling intentions, that \cDiplomat{} is so frequently in your business. It's like your family has instructed \cDiplomat{\them} to make extra sure that you toe the line. Ugh. Come to think of it, \cDiplomat{} was involved in the treaty (aka the betrayal of the \pShippies{}) that was signed the same weekend \cHeirSibling{} was murdered. You suspect that may not be a coincidence, and feel a simmering dislike deep down that is just waiting for proof of \cDiplomat{}'s involvement to bloom into full blown loathing. 

As if that's not bad enough, \cDiplomat{} was also the one who arranged your betrothal so many years ago to \cChupStudent{\full}. The \cChupStudent{\formal}s are mid-tier Children of the Sun nobility, and hold lands on the border with the \pTech{}. They are profiting from the war due to imports and exports between your nation and theirs, and your family believes they will make powerful allies. Much as you resent being used as a political pawn, your feelings about the arrangement have recently become\ldots{} complicated. As children you and \cChupStudent{} were like oil and water, blaming one another for the betrothal forced on you both by \cDiplomat{} and your parents. Since you've seen \cChupStudent{\them} at school, however, your feelings have definitely started to change, which is confusing. \cChupStudent{} sure grew up HOT since you last saw \cChupStudent{\them} a couple of years before, and you haven't had the courage to really engage \cChupStudent{\them} in conversation yet because you're pretty sure \cChupStudent{\they} still can't stand you. Still, you keep finding your eyes drawn back to \cChupStudent{\them} again and again, and it's been a massive drain to keep your mind focused on the task at hand. 

This all came to a head just this morning, when \cDiplomat{} came to you with a letter from your family. Apparently, in their \emph{infinite} wisdom, your family has decided that you're getting married to \cChupStudent{} -- this Monday! You weren't even remotely ready to face your feelings yet, and you greatly resent being forced into this without your knowledge or consent. Even if you would probably have chosen to pursue \cChupStudent{} eventually without the pressure, you're conflicted about accepting under these circumstances -- particularly with your imminent plans to leave your position behind. You aren't sure how either family, or \cChupStudent{} for that matter, will respond to your abandoning the Heirship. It is very possible that they would immediately try to change the arrangement and claim that the marriage is specifically to ``the Heir to the \cHeir{\formal} family'' rather than to ``\cHeir{\full}.'' Wouldn't that be the most ironic turn of events? You come around to the idea of marrying \cChupStudent{} only to have your family take it away from you after trying to push it on you for so long. Not that that particular argument should hold much water, \cHeirSibling{} was the heir when the deal was struck, and you don't have a younger sibling for them to try to latch onto either.

Well, at least if your relationship with \cChupStudent{} goes south, you still might have a chance with \cPresident{\full}. You've caught \cPresident{} sneaking glances at you from across the room many times, and more frequently since the two of you began conspiring on the ritual to look 6 years into the past and see what happened to the students. With\cPresident{}, there is a lot to like. Student body president, smooth talker, and easy on the eyes as well, you soon found yourself wondering what life would be like with \cPresident{} instead of \cChupStudent{}. It would be really nice if you could be with both at the same time somehow, but that just isn't done where you come from. At least, not without scandal. Besides, you're all from different walks of life, and different nations to boot. At the very least, the ongoing war would mean that a relationship with \cPresident{} would be across battle lines — that is, unless the war were to be resolved soon\ldots{}

While you're busy with the important business of discovering \cHeirSibling{}'s killer and escaping your fate as the Faledon Heir, you also have some ideas about how to get back at \cDiplomat{} for the mess \cDiplomat{\they} \cDiplomat{\have} made of your life. Your close friend, \cWarlordDaughter{\full}, is trying to figure out why \cWarlordDaughter{\their} \cLoud{\parent} has taken on the mantle of Warlord to the \pShippies{}, in a complete reversal of \cLoud{\their} earlier pacifistic attitudes, and you know if you can help \cWarlordDaughter{}, you might also help ease the path of the three nations to forge a new treaty and end the war. Since \cDiplomat{} was the creator of the original ``treaty'' that led to the start of the war, this would be a real triumph over \cDiplomat{\them}. \cDiplomat{} isn't the only one who can manipulate a situation to accomplish their goals!  

You're also interested to see the presentation \cHeadScientist{\full} is giving this weekend.  The treaty \cDiplomat{} made with the \pFarm{} relies completely on the promise that \pTech{} will provide a technological way to permanently end the Storm. You've heard your \cFaledonParent{\parent} talking about it with visiting Council members at your home. What strikes you, and apparently your \cFaledonParent{\parent} as well, is that your company has not yet been approached to manufacture anything, and you've got the market basically cornered on manufacturing. Maybe you'll be able to learn something here, and maybe, just maybe, it'll be something that you can use against \cDiplomat{}\ldots

In between everything else going on this weekend, you hope there'll be enough time for you to also get involved in the Ceremony of Excellence that \cMusic{\full} is organizing. You'd really like to take the opportunity to showcase your skills – and maybe catch the interest of certain individuals – by being one of the combat demonstrator during the show. You are, of course, the most qualified individual, as you've been schooled in magical combat from a very early age, so it will be a win-win for the school. You'll need to be proactive to ensure you are the one chosen, though. 

At least while you're busy with so much this weekend, you'll have a chance to catch up with \cAssistantScientist{\full}, who you recently met at an event your parents hosted. The two of you hit it off, and have been friends since. You were happy to learn that \cAssistantScientist{\they} will be attending as an advisor this weekend. \cAssistantScientist{} is about the age \cHeirSibling{} would have been. It's a little like having an older sibling again.

Ultimately, while you're desperate to escape the choking grasp of your fate, and sticking it to \cDiplomat{} would be the triumph of a lifetime, the mission that lies closest to your heart is seeking out the one responsible for murdering \cHeirSibling{} and the other students six years ago. Even if you had to sacrifice everything else you care about to do it, it would be worth it to you. You are going to get to the truth, and nothing is going to stop you. This weekend is your chance to leave the powerlessness of childhood behind and grab your own destiny with both hands. Maybe some freedom will even let you figure out what it is you DO want to do with your life! Whatever it is, wherever, and with whomever, your future will be your own once you can get closure for your \cHeirSibling{\sibling}'s murder and free yourself from the family lineage. Not to mention how happy it would make \cAmbition{} to take over the yoke of leadership that you loathe. Your \cFaledonParent{\parent} may not like it at first, but you know that everything you are doing this weekend will ultimately benefit the Faledon family as well.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Find out what happened to the students – most importantly \cHeirSibling{} -- 6 years ago.
	\item Escape the Faledon family by making \cAmbition{} the Heir in your place, and help smooth the transition as best you can.
	\item Find love with \cChupStudent{} or \cPresident{}. If only you could find a way to be with both\ldots{}
	\item Help \cWarlordDaughter{} figure out why \cLoud{} changed, and if possible use that knowledge to mess with \cDiplomat{}'s treaty.
	\item Investigate the scientists' claims of being able to eliminate the Storms.
	\item Win a spot as a combat demonstrator in the Ceremony of Excellence.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are graduating this year.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} A long time ally of the Faledon Family, and as such is a persistent thorn in your side, and maybe worse. As the creator of the treaty forged six years ago that brought about the betrayal of the \pShip{} by the \pTech{} and the \pFarm{}, \cDiplomat{} is ultimately responsible for the current war between the nations.
	\contact{\cAmbition{}} Your close friend who has seen you through thick and thin, and you can think of nobody better qualified, or more eager, for the kind of power your family wields.  \cAmbition{} is everything you aren't, and for some reason, that's only brought you closer as friends.
	\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} A friend from \pShip{} who you've grown close with during your time at the \pSc{}. As the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of the Warlord leading the \pShippies{} so successfully into battle, \cWarlordDaughter{} seems as unlike \cWarlordDaughter{\their} family as you are to yours.
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} Your intended future \cChupStudent{\spouse}, and as such has been your childhood irritation from the start. That's all changed now though, and you'd like nothing better than to start over with a clean slate and get to know \cChupStudent{\them} better romantically. If only they felt the same\ldots{} and you weren't being forced to marry in a few days.
	\contact{\cPresident{}} Charming to say the least, and it seems like \cPresident{\they} might return your interest. Why is love so complicated?? You aren't sure how to pick one.
	\contact{\cAssistantScientist{}} A friend you're looking forward to catching up with this weekend. \cAssistantScientist{\theyare} also an assistant scientist on the project to end the Storms, and therefore a potential resource in your investigation into that research.
