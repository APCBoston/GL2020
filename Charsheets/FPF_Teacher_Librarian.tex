%% Rachel Reddick AKA Rachel AKA FPF Teacher Librarian

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

You are \cLibrarian{} (\cLibrarian{\they}/\cLibrarian{\them}), and the Librarian at the \pSchool{}. And\ldots that’s about all you remember. You aren’t even sure you remember that so much as your parents impressed these details upon you only a month ago. You must be from \pTech{}, as that is where your family is. You must be the Librarian, for you found your name on the office door.

You killed someone. You must have. Amnesia like this is the punishment the gods dole out for murder. It was supposed to be a mercy; a way to make it easier to rehabilitate and reintegrate people into society. But how can you repent what you cannot remember? And the people of \pEarth{} have no love of amnesiacs. Many are still shunned by society, as if someone’s desire to murder another human being were as inate as one’s hair color, instead of a product of the circumstances in which they were raised.

So at your parent’s urging, you are keeping quiet about it. You returned to your job at the \pSchool{}, and now you spend hours wandering the stacks when no one is looking, hoping to find so much as a single clue about who you were. You’ve found scraps. Just scraps for now, but if you keep looking, surely something will come together. You pray to \cTechGod{} in the quiet of your morning meditations, and you can’t help but feel \cTechGod{\their} hand on you. \cTechGod{\They} want you to succeed.

So what do you know? You know that you are patient and kind. Your office is full of plants that your body knows how to care for almost on an instinctive level -- and though there are many, you feel at ease as you care for them. As for kindness, you can feel it in the way the students talk to you. They come to you for little things, or just to talk, and even the most trivial request fills you with joy to fill. They also, fortunately enough, seem to like you enough to tolerate your missteps as you learn to be yourself again. You may not know much about yourself -- but it’s a start.

You’ve worked out that \cPresident{} and \cLibAssist{} are two students that you spent a lot of time with in the Library before. \cLibAssist{} seems to be your assistant -- and has been a godsend in getting your work done. \cPresident{} you’re not as sure about -- \cPresident{\they} might just be studious? Either way, both seem to know a lot about the library, and you’ve learned quite a bit about how to navigate the place safely by claiming to want to test their knowledge. With how dangerous the library is, though, that isn’t quite enough. Fortunately, just last week, you felt yourself duck automatically to avoid a magical trip-wire that would have likely set off something unpleasant. Your body must retain some things that your mind doesn’t -- and that will be a huge help in keeping your secret.

The discovery of your instinctive ability to protect yourself from the dangers of the Library has given you the confidence you needed. One of your first thoughts was that the answer to your problem must lurk SOMEWHERE in the Library -- but you were certain that searching for it in your current state was suicide. Since that incident, you’ve been delving deeper and searching for answers. If only you had more time! This weekend, you will probably be under more scrutiny than ever. You need to find a way to reverse this memory loss as soon as humanly possible.

In addition to the two students, \cEthics{}, the Ethics and Morality teacher, has also been a big help. When \cEthics{\they} first approached you after the holiday, you were nervous. When \cEthics{\they} asked point blank if you’d lost your memories after just a few minutes, you nearly died on the spot. But apparently, you were very good friends before. \cEthics{} has been kind, sweet, and patient with you, and done a lot to cover for your missteps in the last few weeks. You are really grateful to have \cEthics{\their} help -- and \cEthics{\their} presence has started to be your primary source of comfort. You even find yourself wondering sometimes if the two of you might not become more than just friends.

Among the librarian’s duties are to lead the preparations for the Ritual to control the Storm. \cEthics{} has helped you put together a partial list of what that entails, but without the full story, you’ll need to tread carefully, lest someone suspect something. The most obvious part is keeping track of the Relics. There are 3 Relics that are stored in the library for safe keeping: the \iNet{}, the \iLariat{}, and the \iScythe{}. These Relics must not be allowed to leave the island under any circumstances. You should also make sure that the relics arriving with the advisors go home with whichever advisor they came with. You are also supposed to help with repairing the normal wear and tear on the bunkers. This one you’ve got no idea about, or even if you’re SUPPOSED to know how to fix them yourself. You can only hope that \cBunker{}, the engineer in charge of maintenance, is the type to issue clear orders and not expect much of you.

Life at the \pSchool{} is actually quite idyllic. Most everyone gets along. The teachers are like one, big, extended family that transcends country divisions in a way not possible anywhere else on \pEarth{}. The students are inquisitive and clever, and you can see a bright future for \pEarth{} in their hearts and minds. As you sit and watch people bustle about their various tasks, you’ve taken up the age old pastime of shipping your students and colleagues. The match that has struck you most strongly is \cHeadScientist{} and \cChupAvenger{}. It hit you this morning when \cHeadScientist{} arrived, and you caught the look on \cChupAvenger{}’s face. \cChupAvenger{} is a good sort. \cChupAvenger{\They} teach\cChupAvenger{\plural} art, and when \cChupAvenger{\they} saw \cHeadScientist{}, it was clear to you that \cChupAvenger{\they} saw the world. You’d like to help them get together if you can.

This weekend is a race against time to see if you can piece together a ritual that will restore your memories before anyone finds out you are an amnesiac and kicks you out. In the meantime, you have duties for the Library and the \pSc{} to perform or fake as best you can. Fortunately, you’re not alone -- and if your reputation is as good as you think it is, you just might make it through unscathed.

%Librarian??  Researcher... Amnesiac???  Killed someone who was in severe pain but doesn't remember it, spends game trying to figure out who did I kill and why, am I a bad guy, how do I keep this secret.

%\cLibrarian{} cares about order, calm, organization, status quo, and helping solve problems.  She finds satisfaction in the library.  The more she engages with the library, the more library memories come back to her, but not the personal knowledge.  The gods punish her less by letting her have a few memories back because she was very devout, and killed out of kindness.  The FPF god doesn't want other gods to know.
%
%\cEthics{} is their friend/ally, know they are an amnesiac, so does \cInterpol{}, lesser ally, doesn't know who they killed, but is convinced they are a good person.
