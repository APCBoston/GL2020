\section*{Who are the \pGoaties{}?}
The \pGoaties{} follow the teachings of the \cGenesis{\Deity} \cGenesis{}, the \cGenesis{\Deity} of Fortune. The primary themes of their teachings are equality, fairness, and the nobility of self-sacrifice. The \pGoaties{} believe that all people should have the same opportunities and abilities, and that those who have more should give their resources to those who have less. In particular, the \pGoaties{} strive to eliminate economic inequality, which is otherwise impossible to escape from in the world at large.

In general, the \pGoaties{} are very open about taboos. Criticizing the leadership or the teachings of \cGenesis{} is frowned upon, but is outwardly embraced since freedom of speech is encouraged. Respect for every identity, nationality, and social class is ingrained in group teachings. The acceptance of those without means in particular is a strong method of recruitment in the more restrictive corners of society.

As an organization, they largely look on people outside of the fold with pity, and always strive to find those that they can safely induct into their superior lifestyle. It is said that one day, the Chosen will recreate \pEarth{} as a promised land -- a commune of the faithful who will live together in harmony\ldots

\section*{History of the \pGoaties{}}
The \pGoaties{} were founded and built up by the immensely charismatic leader, whose name and appearance is known only to a few, usually the oldest members. While young, they have a nearly supernatural ability to sway people to their side. As a citizen of the \pShip{}, \cGenesis{}’s Chosen started the group on their ship. With the freedom not to have to hide from friends and family, the Chosen was able to visit and spread their teaching, not just throughout \pShip{} territory, but to the \pTech{} and the \pFarm{} as well. It was during these trips that the Chosen met those who would eventually be selected as Bishops to serve as their generals in other nations. Similar to the Chosen, the identity of the Bishops is secret even within the group.

The \pGoaties{} popularity surged 6 years ago in \pShip{} following the first time the storms went to \pShip{} unjustly, riding the same tide of resentment that sparked the war.

\section*{Structure}
The \pGoaties{} are structured in cells that communicate only with the adjoining cells, passing information and orders between leaders via coded signals and dead drops at ever updating locations, depending on the complexity of the message. \pShip{} has around twice the number of cells of \pTech{} and \pFarm{} combined. These cells often, but not always, map to full boats. The leader of a cell receives their orders in a game of telephone from the previous cell all the way from the Bishops or the Chosen.

\section*{Membership}
The \pGoaties{} take all kinds. Some of their most valuable members are the rare inventors with talent who are turned away by the Temple. The group finds ways to help them to enable their inventions, and in return reaps the benefit from the brilliant and the mediocre alike. Other, less talented members from \pTech{} are also welcomed, mostly from those without much who are lured by the promise of power and purpose.

Another source of recruits are commoners from \pFarm{} who just want to have some agency in their lives and the right to real property, away from the oppressive hand of the nobility. The group has promised large swaths of land to its \pFarm{} recruits once \cGenesis{} comes to the fore.

The largest group by far, however, comes from the \pShip{}. Disillusioned with the betrayal of the rest of the world and resonating with the message of balance they grew up with, \pShippies{} are the base of power of the \pGoaties{}. It doesn’t hurt that the governing council has yet to crack down on the more obvious crimes that the group commits, giving the group tacit legitimacy.

The \pGoaties{} of course do not have official representation at the school. However, they have pulled a lot of strings and taken many risks to sneak a few of their highest ranking supporters onto the list of those attending this Time of Deciding. Due to the cell structure, no one Follower knows every Follower here, so establishing contact and the pecking order will be top priority. 

\section*{External Relations}
The \pGoaties{} have maintained a remarkably low profile throughout their (relatively) short lifespan considering their methods, but avoiding the notice of the powerful entirely was impossible. Their profile is highest in \pShip{}, of course, and even average citizens have heard whispers there. Many \pShippies{} are sympathetic to the group's message, even if they don’t participate themselves -- their message of fairness and true equality strike a chord with many, as they are seemingly based on \pShip{} culture. Because of the democratic nature of \pShip{}, this has led to a lack of a strong resolution condemning the \pGoaties{}'s criminal activities, though a growing faction has been trying to drum up support to prosecute them.

The \pTech{} and the \pFarm{} think of the \pGoaties{} as criminals due to their contraband and theft of intellectual property. However, they have not made enough of a nuisance of themselves there to be prioritized above other criminal organizations, allowing their foothold to spread.

\section*{The Black Market}
The \pGoaties{} raise funds primarily via a thriving black market, using the connections already put in place to transfer goods and services clandestinely throughout the three nations. Intermediate steps in the chain do their best not to know exactly what it is they are smuggling. However, one of the primary draws of \pGoaties{} is the ability to access technology you would never receive normally based on your social class. 

From the \pTech{}, \pGoaties{} can enjoy appliances, wearable technology, and fancy clothes.
From the \pFarm{}, they can enjoy curses and cursed items, as well as exotic spices and food. And from the \pShip{}, they can find weapons, crafting supplies, and the materials to craft superior boats.

The black market pipelines are also used to deliver mail within \pFarm{}, which otherwise wouldn't be able to travel between peasants born with magic (and subsequently ``adopted’’ into noble house) and their birth families.

\section*{Methods}
The \pGoaties{} follow the standard cult playbook -- ease the new recruit in with friendship, relatable worries, and concerns, then slowly step up the radical messages until it reaches the level of brainwashing. Religious services are intense and mentally draining, in deliberate contrast to the tamer religious services available elsewhere. The group also deliberately isolates members from their existing relationships in order to make the inductee as susceptible and dependent on the group as possible. Above all else, the \pGoaties{} are encouraged to read the writings of the Chosen daily, which are charismatic enough to energize and deepen faith.

When executing solo or small group missions, they often operate in plain sight, relying on speed and shock to get their work done. When congregating as a full cell, however, they are much more careful to avoid prying eyes, hiding in the forest, having inducted a full ship, or meeting in an abandoned warehouse as appropriate to their country of residence.

\section*{Technology and Magic}
The technology available to \pGoaties{} is composed of the most useful technologies from other nations, which in practice means that it most closely resembles that of the \pTech{}. However, \pGoaties{} also heavily encourages research into branches of magic deemed too dangerous and unprofitable by \pTech{}. This does not often yield results, but has done so several times in the past. The two most useful of these feats were: 

1. A means to probe a target's mind for their secrets at the cost of some of both the target and caster's sanity.
2. A way to permanently transfer the caster's magic ability to another (something the leadership sometimes solicits for their own power).

In addition, the Chosen has passed down several persuasive magical techniques to certain select cell leaders, which they use to great effect.

\section*{Avengers}
The \pGoaties{} do not believe in the inherent wrongness of murder when the target is someone who hoards power or assists those who do. As an expression of power, \cGenesis{} has managed to twist the universal law against murder for \pGoaties{}. Instead of losing your own memories when you kill another, others instead lose their memories of you -- until, finally, no one remembers who you are and you cease to be. This has led \pGoaties{} to train and use some extremely effective assassins in a world where career assassins are basically unheard of -- and the evidence for those assassinations often vanishes from the minds of those around the target. These religious assassins, known as Avengers, live a lonely life in service of their beliefs, but an effective one. It is unknown what happens to Avengers after everyone forgets their existence.

\section*{Goals}
The primary goal is to subvert the Ritual to control the Storm in order to keep the storm at the school. Doing so will be a percussive revelation to the world of the \pGoaties{}’s existence by destroying many of the most powerful people in the 3 nations and the very symbol of the existing power structure, the \pSchool{}.

\section*{Costuming}
The \pGoaties{} strive to maintain secrecy, and so always masquerade as a normal citizen of their nation of origin. However, they do keep a small item in the shape of a clover on their person at all times to prove their allegiance to others they may meet that they may have never seen before.
