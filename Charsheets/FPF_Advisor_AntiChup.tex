%%Black AKA David Black AKA FPF Advisor AntiChup; needs to be really attached to Shantih otherwise plots fall flat

You are \cAntiChup{\full} (\cAntiChup{\they}/\cAntiChup{\them}), citizen of the \pTech{} and in the prime of your career at 63.  As the Head Priest, you are the true power behind the Temple of \cTechGod{}, overseeing the faith and the faithful of your nation, as well as the \pTech{} spy network. While your friend and colleague \cCouncilPriest{} holds the higher formal title of \cTechGod{}’s Grace and deals with the bureaucracy of the Council position, you are empowered to use your own less conspicuous power to keep the beating heart of the Temple under your finely gloved thumb. 

This weekend you’ll have the honor of attending \pSchool{} as an Advisor, and while you’ve held this role before, this time feels especially momentous as a personal success. Your own protege, \cScholarship{}, will be attending as one of the students honored with the sacred privilege of voting to direct the Gods’ mighty Storm. It is through your decades of hard work and cutthroat determination that you now find yourself at this most auspicious event, not only as the voice of \cTechGod{} \cTechGod{\them}self, but also in such a position to raise up this most promising young devotee in your own image, empowering \cScholarship{\them} to continue your work and further your power both nationally and abroad. You’ll do \emph{whatever} it takes to ensure that this weekend is a success in all ways, and you couldn’t be more thrilled at the prospect of such victories.  

Your relationship with \cScholarship{} is somewhat complicated. \cScholarship{} attends the school by the grace of a Temple scholarship you arranged personally, and so will of course do your bidding. Originally, this was all there was to your relationship -- but you, uncharacteristically, began to develop a certain fondness for your young pupil. You have, unfortunately, only realized this recently -- only after the latest enterprise you forced \cScholarship{\them} through that you’re sure \cScholarship{\they} found unpleasant. Some time after \cScholarship{} returned from executing your plot to slay one of the \pShip{} avatars, you happened to intercept one of \cScholarship{\their} outgoing letters -- and therein, learned that \cScholarship{} wanted to leave your tutelage. 

You expected to feel nothing but vague annoyance at another tool breaking -- but from the degree of hurt you felt, you realized that you had developed quite a distressing degree of \cAntiChup{\parent}ly feelings toward \cScholarship{\them}. You have allowed yourself to indulge in these thoughts to some extent -- enough to acknowledge that ultimately you do want to see \cScholarship{} happy. It is next to impossible for you to conceive of how \cScholarship{\they} could be happy with a different mentor -- no one can smooth \cScholarship{\their} way to the upper echelons of the church like you. No one could give them half the power that you could. Perhaps \cScholarship{\they} just need\cScholarship{\plural} a serious talking to, to come to \cScholarship{\their} senses? Starting the conversation will be challenging, as you are loathe to admit that you’ve been going through \cScholarship{\their} mail. If ultimately \cScholarship{} chooses the suboptimal path, and insists on leaving you, all is not lost. \cScholarship{\Their} new sponsor will need to convince you that \emph{they} are worthy of \cScholarship{} before you will agree to sign away \cScholarship{}’s scholarship documentation.

Regardless, there is work for \cScholarship{} to do. The first order of business for both you and \cScholarship{\them} is on the all important matter of the vote to direct the Storm.  The hardest part will be ensuring that it is \cScholarship{} who gains the highest rank in voting authority. Your protege is the underdog in this particular race, with the \cHeir{\child} of the mighty Faledon family, \cHeir{}, as the forerunner. Thanks to the Faledon family’s staunch ally \cDiplomat{} attending this weekend, it’s unlikely you’ll be the one dictating how \cHeir{} votes, so your best bet is to find a way to weaken \cHeir{\their} lead with the teachers -- who also get a say in assigning voting authority -- and put your own carefully cultivated pawn into play in  \cHeir{}’s place. It is, after all, crucial that the Storm be sent once again to the \pShip{} so that the treaty protecting your nation from the Storm, and starvation, is upheld. It is your sacred duty to protect your people, and \cTechGod{}’s will that you should succeed by any means necessary. And while you're pulling the strings in your own nation, it would also be of great benefit if you could similarly find ways to ensure that the students from \pFarm{} also uphold their nation’s end of the shared treaty.

You have also assigned \cScholarship{\them} another task. Everyone knows that \cInitiate{} and \cWarlordDaughter{} are initiates to the \pShip{} religious structure, but information from your spy network suggests that \cPirate{}, one of the teachers, may also be trying to become a \cPirate{\cleric}. Such a thing is unheard of in someone \cPirate{\their} age, but it does present an opportunity. While messing with \cWarlordDaughter{} might upset too much of delicate balance that is war, \cInitiate{} and \cPirate{} are both valid targets to become spies for you in the \pShip{}. You have written up a plan to acquire influence over both of them involving magical blackmail and digging into their secrets, and delivered it to \cScholarship{}, ready to execute. This presents a perfect opportunity -- both to put your protege’s skills to the possibly final test, and, more importantly, to get your fingers into the future of \pShip{}’s Temple. To this end, you have contracted the help of the \pSc{}’s cursebreaking teacher -- \cPrince{}, to whom you promised to support in a bid for the throne. In exchange \cPrince{\they} sent you several curses vital to this effort.

Of course, \cScholarship{} isn’t the only one with work to perform. As a \cAntiChup{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}, you have duties to perform -- things like healing and leading rituals. This task is made more challenging by your counterpart, \cBeetle{}. \cBeetle{} is \emph{technically} a \cBeetle{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}, but has clearly gone soft. \cBeetle{\They} are slow to act, and slow to pass information back to the church and \cBeetle{\their} home country, to which they owe allegiance. You do not expect to be able to rely on \cBeetle{} for all but the most trivial duties.

This leaves the most important role of a \cAntiChup{\cleric} of \cTechGod{} to you: striking against any and all blasphemy against \cTechGod{}. The heaviest form of blasphemy is that which is perpetrated by the \pGoaties{} -- an infamous cult that has been insidiously growing in the shadows over the last decade. You plan to make good use of the opportunities afforded you this weekend to hunt down and obliterate the leadership of the \pGoaties{}, and thus mitigate their unholy influence upon your meticulously built world. Those in the know, hunting these blasphemous rebels -- yourself foremost among them -- feel confident that the \pGoaties{} run the Black Market, an international scourge. More times than you care to count, you’ve read reports of your own people being killed on the battlefield by weapons developed by their countrymen, stolen from the \pTech{} and sold illegally to your nation’s enemies. And while most consider the \pShippies{} to be the nation’s sole enemies, you are not so naive. 

In fact, you’ve pieced together from various spy reports that the highest ranking members of the \pGoaties{}, including their ever elusive leader, are going to be present at \pSchool{} this very weekend. They no doubt have some unholy evils planned and it is paramount that you not only stop them, but catch them red-handed. The salvation of your nation is, as always, the precious and sacred burden granted you by \cTechGod{} -- so you’ll use every trick, tool, and person in your arsenal to bring the \pGoaties{} to their knees and end this ridiculous notion of a fifth major God. You have compiled a list of suspects -- and you plan to personally investigate each and every one to find and root out this evil.

This weekend will be a whirlwind. You expect to be kept quite busy by your investigations, negotiations, and wrangling your wayward protege. But just like in all things before now, you will not fail. You are backed by not only \cTechGod{}, highest of Gods -- but also the collective will of the entire \pTech{}.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Find the \pGoaties{}, stop whatever they currently have planned, accumulate evidence of their myriad past crimes, and bring them to justice for it all.
	\item Shut down the black market.
\item Ensure that \cScholarship{} gets the highest number of votes to control the storm among the \pTech{} students. By any means necessary, enforce that the storm be sent to the \pShip{}, to preserve the treaty between the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}.
	\item Convince \cScholarship{} that \cScholarship{\their} best chance of a successful life and career, and therefore happiness, is by remaining under your tutelage. If \cScholarship{\They} will not see reason, at least vet their potential new mentor with great care to make sure they are worthy.
	\item Keep an eye on the preparations for the Ritual to control the storm, and assist as necessary given your role as \cAntiChup{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You want \cScholarship{} to get the most votes to control the storm out of the \pTech{} students.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cScholarship{}} Your protege, who you think of almost as a \cScholarship{\child}. \cScholarship{\They} \cScholarship{\are} one of your most valuable tools to accomplish your goals this weekend.
\contact{\cPrince{}} A collaborator in your bid to corrupt the rising \pShip{} priests. You promised support for the throne in exchange for \cPrince{\their} help with curses.
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} The other \cBeetle{\cleric} here. \cBeetle{\They} seem to be ignoring \cBeetle{\their} responsibilities toward \pTech{}.
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} Your advisor counterpart at the negotiating table. Where you represent the Temple, \cDiplomat{\they} represent\cDiplomat{\plural} the government. \cDiplomat{} is a moderately competent diplomat, having forged the original treaty 6 years ago. Still, \cDiplomat{\they} favor \cHeir{} to be the student with the highest voting authority, and you simply cannot allow that.
