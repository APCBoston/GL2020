\name{\cJuniorStatesman{}}

You are \cJuniorStatesman{\full} (\cJuniorStatesman{\they}/\cJuniorStatesman{\them}), and 38 years old. You are an advisor from the \pShip{}, and while you weren't expecting to be in charge, you feel surprisingly ready for the challenge. Your patron deities \cEbbFull{\full} and \cFlowFull{\full} are the Goddesses of balance - and time is a key element in creating that balance. Wrongs of the past can, and must, be righted in the present. The Treaty, the Storm, and the Avatars of the Gods are all just tools to accomplish that ultimate goal. It is your job as a diplomat to see the bigger picture, and to make the best use of the tools available to you -- even in the face of those that cannot see that the ends justify those means. This weekend is going to be a big turning point for you and your country - you'll make sure of that.

As a child, you attended 2nd Fleet academy in order to study politics, and have since spent most of your adult life working under \cHeadDiplomat{\full}. \cHeadDiplomat{\Theyare} one of the foremost diplomats of \pShip{}, and a damn good one. You have seen \cHeadDiplomat{\them} broker compromises from impossible situations in the span of an hour, and no problem was ever too big, or too small, for \cHeadDiplomat{\their} personal attention. \cHeadDiplomat{} has the keenest sense for when those little things will sway someone to your side. While you could never fully fill those gigantic shoes, you have done your best to learn everything you possibly could from \cHeadDiplomat{\them}. This weekend was supposed to  be the culmination of your 7 year apprenticeship, and your graduation from journeyman to master in your own right. But now \cHeadDiplomat{} has lost \cHeadDiplomat{\their} memories, and \cEbbPriest{\full} is in charge. 

You woke up to the dreadful news only yesterday, with a messenger boy pounding on your door. Everything happened so fast after that. A \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{} was called, who quickly took over the situation, confining you and \cChupLeader{\full}, \cHeadDiplomat{}'s secretary, while \cEbbPriest{\they} ``investigated'’. Hours later, \cEbbPriest{} debriefed you, explaining that \cHeadDiplomat{} had apparently \emph{killed someone}, and had \cHeadDiplomat{\their} memories promptly wiped by the Deities. You could hardly believe your ears! \cHeadDiplomat{} was always so mild-mannered, kind, and patient. What possible reason could \cHeadDiplomat{\they} have had to kill someone? But the proof was there right in front of you -- missing memories, and a bloody knife in a corpse.

\cEbbPriest{} thought the answer was obvious -- \cHeadDiplomat{} was trying to broker a peace treaty to end the war between the nations. Someone, from which nation was anyone's guess, must have sent the assassin in order to stop that. While the answer was easy and convincing enough on its face, somehow it didn't sit quite right with you. It was \textbf{too} tidy an answer. Seven years at \cHeadDiplomat{}'s side has taught you that the easy answer is rarely the right one when international politics are involved.

Still, someone had to show up at the \pSchool{} and make sure the \pTech{} and the \pFarm{} didn't continue to ride roughshod over the \pShip{}. As you contemplated whether you were really ready to step up and fill \cHeadDiplomat{}'s shoes, \cEbbPriest{} declared that \cEbbPriest{\they} \cEbbPriest{\were} going to lead the delegation. You thought that presumptuous of them, but there wasn't really time to argue; if you didn't leave immediately you'd miss the boat (literally). Besides, \cEbbPriest{} is a very well respected, high ranking \cEbbPriest{\cleric}. \cEbbPriest{\They} would be equal in rank to \cHeadDiplomat{}, so \cEbbPriest{\they} most definitely outrank\cEbbPriest{\plural} you. The story that you are supposed to tell is that \cHeadDiplomat{} became dreadfully ill last night, and couldn't make it. But in general, the fewer details spread around, the better. All questions are to be turned aside, or directed to \cEbbPriest{}. \cEbbPriest{\They} think\cEbbPriest{\plural} \cEbbPriest{\they} \cEbbPriest{\have} this all under control. You aren't so sure about that. You intend to conduct your own investigation into the assassination attempt. You immediately disregarded instructions and wrote to \cHeadDiplomat{}'s \cPresident{\nibling}, \cPresident{\full}, to tell \cPresident{\them} what happened and solicit \cPresident{\their} help. There hasn't been time for a response, but you intend to make contact as soon as you can get \cEbbPriest{} off your case. The only other person who knows what happened to \cHeadDiplomat{} is the fourth \pShippie{} advisor, \cBunker{\full}. 

Now that you're here and not standing directly in your mentor's shadow, you're going to conduct yourself a little differently than your amnesiac mentor would have. While you have a lot of respect for \cHeadDiplomat{} and \cHeadDiplomat{\their} strength of character, you feel the call of the Goddesses' balance leads you on a different path. You strongly believe that your country should extract as much worth as you can from the unjust aggressors from the continent before signing away your rights to make war. Whether or not the other side acknowledges it, this war is firmly in your favor – so the calls for peace between your nations are premature at best. Unless you can extract a large stable of concessions from the \pTech{} and the \pFarm{}, you are firmly against anything stronger than a ceasefire – and only then to give a temporary respite in order to gather your strength for a crushing final blow. Still, a diplomat must be flexible in light of new information. If the tide of the war turns against you, or justice can be done and Balance restored some other way, you would be willing to consider peace. 

Unfortunately, your direct control over that situation is limited at the moment. You were supposed to sit at the bargaining table at \cHeadDiplomat{}'s right hand -- but that all went up in smoke when \cEbbPriest{} took over. \cEbbPriest{} has declared that \cEbbPriest{\they} will handle the treaty negotiations alone, and unfortunately, \cEbbPriest{\their} age and rank technically make \cEbbPriest{\them} your superior. And \cEbbPriest{\theyare} as stubborn as a barnacle. You don't know if arguing is going to help much -- and the work you've gotten in return is important as well. As it stands you've been redirected, at least for the moment, to heading up the Advisors' rankings for student voting authority to direct the Storm. 

Ensuring that the storm is sent somewhere other than the \pShip{} is an important and difficult task. There are so many variables to how the situation will go, and as the apprentice of \cHeadDiplomat{}, you intend to navigate this situation to a satisfactory conclusion. To that end, you have been keeping your eye out for the best student to back from the \pShip{} -- and you think you've picked a winner. \cHeadDiplomat{} has always been fond of \cHeadDiplomat{\their} \cPresident{\nibling}, \cPresident{}. While you have no intention of playing favorites, you have to agree that \cPresident{} is probably the best choice to be given the most voting authority among the \pShippies{}. \cPresident{} has the charisma and the clout to win over some of the students from other nations; a necessary step in protecting the \pShip{}. With your help, you believe \cPresident{} can ensure that the storm is sent to one of your enemy nations, to protect your own people from a third round of battering by the Storm (and maybe even force one of the enemy nations to surrender). You will need to do what you can to convince your fellow \pShip{} advisors, and, somehow, the \pFarm{} teachers, to rank \cPresident{} the highest for voting authority.

Of course, the tides of victory are flowing in your favor in large part because of the incredible strategic mind of Warlord \cLoud{\full}, a \cLoud{\person} whose work has quite impressed you. As one of the strongest military assets on the side of the \pShip{}, you have to do what you can to safeguard and motivate \cLoud{} to keep doing the good work that \cLoud{\theyare} doing. Maybe \cLoud{\their} \cWarlordDaughter{\child}, \cWarlordDaughter{\full}, can be your ticket into \cLoud{}'s good graces, and can help you keep tabs on \cLoud{\their} well-being? You fully expect the other nations to continue to conspire to assassinate the Warlord. You can't protect \cLoud{} directly from here, but you and \cWarlordDaughter{} can foil any plots being hatched here. 

Another person you intend to ingratiate yourself to this weekend is \cBunker{\full}, your fellow advisor and the engineer who designed the school's magical Bunkers. \cBunker{} doesn't seem like much on the surface, but you know that \cBunker{\theyare} a longtime friend and confidante of \cHeadDiplomat{}, and therefore probably more than \cBunker{\they} let\cBunker{\plural} on. Your best bet is probably to volunteer to help \cBunker{} with the maintenance of the Bunkers this weekend.

A bit further from home, there's \cDisney{\full}. \cDisney{\They} wrote to \cHeadDiplomat{} some time back asking for aid in finding the Giant Hummingbirds - Avatars of \cFarmGod{}. \cHeadDiplomat{} passed the letter along to you, knowing your interest in the Avatars.  Ever since you joined the project, you've been extremely interested - but no longer for the reasons that \cDisney{} would hope\ldots{}

One of the only tides flowing against you in this war has been the recent loss of one of the two \pShip{} avatars. \cEbbPriest{} told you the devastating news just yesterday. While the clerics are understandably focused on resurrecting it, it gave you the idea to pursue an alternate approach – you can bring the other nations down a few notches by killing \textbf{their} avatars. If you can find the Hummingbirds and muster the resources to remove them permanently, you will ensure that their presence can't swing the tide of war back in the favor of the \pFarm{}. You suspect that the Hummingbirds have been recalled to the Realm of the Gods. Why \cFarmGod{} did this, you don't know -- that's probably what you and \cDisney{} will be trying to learn. Unless something truly miraculous happens – and it would take a genius with no regard for mortal or divine rules to pull it off – no one can reach the Realm of the Gods anyway, so destroying them might be out of reach. But you can certainly try to make sure they never return to \pEarth{}. \cDisney{} would, of course, be crushed if \cDisney{\they} knew the truth of your intentions. You're still looking for the right moment to convince \cDisney{\them} that your actions are just. Regardless, even destroying \cFarmGod{}'s avatars wouldn't fully restore balance — the Celestial Beetles of \cTechGod{} would also need to be destroyed as well. You aren't aware of any opportunities to do so as they are kept under heavy guard in the High Temple of the \pTech{}, but if the opportunity were to present itself, you would not hesitate.

Another thing of somewhat less import that's been on your mind recently is your love life. You are currently in a stable, loving relationship with your \cBeetle{\partner}, \cBeetle{\full}, and you wouldn't change that for the world. You are just grateful that \cBeetle{\they} teach\cBeetle{\pluralC} at the \pSc{}, so you don't need to worry about \cBeetle{\them} being an enemy agent from \pTech{}, as well as a \cBeetle{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}. After all, the teachers at the \pSc{} are supposed to renounce their national loyalties when they join the faculty. The two of you established from the beginning that your relationship would be a polyamourous one - but neither of you have other partners right now. Just this morning however, upon your arrival here at the \pSchool{}, \cEthics{\full} caught your eye. While \cEthics{} has been teaching at the \pSc{} for a while, you had never taken the time to exchange more than pleasantries with \cEthics{\them}. Today you did, and what a spark. \cEthics{\They} teach\cEthics{\pluralC} Morality and Ethics, and \cEthics{\are} surprisingly interested in justice for the \pShip{}. You would definitely like to see if there's opportunity for romance there. You and \cBeetle{} generally talk about changes to the relationship structure before implementing anything though, so you may want to chat with \cBeetle{\them} before approaching \cEthics{}. You do not have a relationship with veto power, but it is possible to have conversations around making sure needs can still be met, even with a change in the relationship structure.

This weekend will be a tough one. Keeping the ritual on track, ensuring that a signed treaty is favorable to your country, and finding a way to end the Hummingbirds are your most important duties -- but if you can find the time, your love life could use some attention as well. There's a lot at stake in these few days, but it's nothing a soon-to-be master diplomat can't handle.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Protect the interests of the \pShip{}, and do right by your home country, her people, and her Goddesses.
\item Ensure that any treaty that is signed is highly beneficial to the \pShippies{}. If the other nations won't acquiesce, the war can always continue, as long as the Warlord continues to lead you.
	\item Ensure that \cPresident{} gets access to the most votes for controlling the Storm, and influence as many of the students as possible to send the Storm to a nation other than the \pShip{}.
	\item With \cPresident{}'s help, investigate the assassination attempt on \cHeadDiplomat{}. Do so quietly -- it wouldn't do for other nations to find out how close someone came to assassinating the \pShip{}'s most famous diplomat.
	\item Ingratiate yourself to \cBunker{} by assisting \cBunker{\them} in the maintenance of the Bunkers.
	\item Ingratiate yourself to \cWarlordDaughter{}, and through \cWarlordDaughter{\them}, make sure that Warlord \cLoud{} does not falter in leading the \pShip{} war effort to success.
	\item Find the Hummingbird Avatars of \cFarmGod{} with \cDisney{}. If possible, destroy the Giant Hummingbirds of \cFarmGod{}, with or without \cDisney{}'s approval.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You came to the College of the Gods with \cHeadDiplomat{} for the first time 3 years ago.
	\item You aren't quite sure, but you think you recognize \cEvil{\full}. You think you and \cHeadDiplomat{} might have had a nasty encounter with \cEvil{\them} at some point, but you can't remember when or where.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} An \cEbb{} \cEbbPriest{\cleric}, and the self-appointed leader of the delegation from the \pShip{} since \cHeadDiplomat{} has lost \cHeadDiplomat{\their} memories.
	\contact{\cChupLeader{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}'s secretary. You've been casual friends for years, and you have a healthy respect for \cChupLeader{\their} ability to arrange schedules, manage events, and run interference without anyone realizing it.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} A fellow \pShip{} advisor, friend of \cHeadDiplomat{}, and the one in charge of maintaining the \pSc{}'s Bunkers. 
	\contact{\cPresident{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}'s \cPresident{\nibling}, and probably the \pShippies{} best chance at not having the storm directed at them this year.
	\contact{\cDisney{}} A student from the \pFarm{} who is looking for the Giant Hummingbirds.
	\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} The \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of \cLoud{\full}. Gaining \cWarlordDaughter{\their} trust will help you keep tabs on the Warlord. 
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} Your romantic partner, with whom you have a polyamorous relationship. \cBeetle{} is kind, funny, thoughtful, and, a little awkwardly, a \cBeetle{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}.
	\contact{\cEthics{}} The Morality and Ethics teacher at the school, whose dedication to Balance (unusual for a non-\pShip{}) and thoughtfulness caught your attention this morning. You would be interested in getting to know \cEthics{\them} better.
\end{contacts}
