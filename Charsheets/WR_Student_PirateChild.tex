\name{\cPirateChild{}}

%Jos AKA WR Student PirateChild; just arrived at the school this year; not graduating! (18 YO) Phobia of Fire; goes beyond a sailor's healthy fear of it.

You are \cPirateChild{\full} (\cPirateChild{\they}/\cPirateChild{\them}), and 18 years old. You are a \pShip{} pirate, and your job here has been years in the making. You were determined to stick it to ``civilized society’’ and had no intention of actually sticking around the school, but you may have accidentally made some friends here that make your mission\ldots more complicated.

You grew up in the 8th fleet, on the Silent Fog, and your loyalty lies first with your crew and second with your seafaring nation’s people, if not with her laws. The Silent Fog is a notorious pirate ship, terrorizing the coast of \pFarm{} well beyond the normal extortion racket. They are your family, and you are a good pirate, and a damn fine pickpocket. And if your fear of fire is a little stronger than normal for a pirate, no one makes a big deal of it. You weren’t born on the Silent Fog though, or any of the pirate ships she occasionally engages with. You were brought to the ship by one of her former crew who now has a job on land. That job was part of a long term ploy to do something tremendous.

At the \pSchool{} is housed the \iNet{}. This Net is a relic that according to legend was given to the \pShip{} by the Goddesses themselves. And while it can certainly be used to direct the storm, when powered up for the ritual, it can also be used to incredible effect by an individual ship. If the Silent Fog could get the Net, it would be able to control the waters in the \pWod{} - it would be uncatchable. Your job is to liberate the \iNet{}, attuned to \pShip{}, without it being used for the ritual, and bring it home. 

You don’t have to do this alone - the former crew member is here. Somewhere. Their coded messages say so. But it was agreed upon, long before you could read those codes, that it was best to wait until the last minute for you to make contact. This is the last minute, and you need to find someone who will respond to the phrase ``the Waters untouched are not abandoned.’’ with ``Those brave enough chart the course.’’ The two of you will then need to devise a way to steal the \iNet{} and get it home. You’ll only get one shot at this as their cover will be blown after this - so make it count, and make sure the two of you get home safely.

Speaking of that pirate, as if finding them weren’t already important enough, your dreams have been restless of late. The past three nights you’ve had dreams about the parent who gave you up all those 17 years ago. Last night, the message was most emphatic - apparently you are supposed to find them. Apparently \cPirateChildParent{\they} will be at the \pSc{} this weekend. You would probably have ignored the suggestion, except that it had divine weight behind it. Too bad the deity couldn’t be bothered to reveal themself. Still, when a Deity says climb the rigging, you climb first and ask ``how high?’’ later. The pirate who is here undercover is the self-same one who brought you to the Silent Fog all those years ago. They have to know something about who gave you to them - so you must start your investigation there.

But now you’re getting ahead of yourself. When your mysterious crewmate wrote to the ship that they would need a second agent to liberate the \iNet{}, there was somewhat of a scramble to find a way to get a student into the school. It was great luck that you hit upon \cWildCard{} as a contact. \cWildCard{\They} are a noble\cWildCard{\person} of \pFarm{}, with holdings on the coast. During one of the Silent Fog’s visits to collect protection money, \cWildCard{} approached you with a most unusual offer. \cWildCard{\They} offered to bankroll your campaign bid to the \pSchool{}, if you agreed to pretend to be friends with \cDisney{}, some \cDisney{\kid} \cWildCard{\they} were taking an interest in. Well that solved that problem neatly, and perhaps not everyone in \pFarm{} is so bad.  Could peace with them happen, if the terms were in your nation’s best interest?

Until you arrived at the \pSchool{} and actually met \cDisney{}. Pretending to be friends very quickly melted into being \emph{actual} friends. \cDisney{\They} were asleep for 2 centuries - everyone \cDisney{\they} know and love are gone. You aren’t sentimental or anything, but the two of you just really hit it off.

You get along so well that when you learned it was \cDisney{}’s birthday the same weekend as the Storm, you knew you had to do something big. At first the idea seemed ridiculous and over the top. But the more you thought about it, the more enamored of it you became. You snuck a sea serpent egg into the school with you. Your patience ran out though, and you showed it to \cDisney{} early. Unfortunately \cDisney{\they} \cDisney{were}n’t as keen on the idea as you, pointing out things like how big sea serpents get. That is definitely a problem, but one to solve\ldots later. With \cAdopted{}’s help, the two of you disguised the egg as a rock while you tried to figure out what to do. And now that it’s hatched, the disguise spell from \cAdopted{} needs to be re-cast, and the precious little thing taken care of. Who knew they ate so much? And it’s not a very convincing stuffed animal when it keeps\ldots wiggling and sneezing. Maybe trying to gift your friend a creature as which the \pEarth{}n Avatars of the Goddesses can manifest wasn’t the best idea\ldots And it’s a good thing they don’t breathe fire. Still, it would be a shame to have the cute little thing taken away, and \cDisney{} does seem very attached to it now that it’s hatched.

And then there is the internship offer. You’ve been receiving letters for the past few months that you’ve been at the school from one \cEvil{}. \cEvil{\They} are offering you some sort of internship with \cEvil{\them}in the \pFarm{}. You certainly don’t have any intention of actually taking \cEvil{\them} up on it, but playing along is important to maintaining your cover.

Maintaining your cover is hard, especially with so many excellent things to steal. You were always an expert pickpocket, having learned from the best, and the school is just full of deep pockets and valuable trinkets that aren’t nailed down. You’ve even managed to steal small things from some of the teachers’ offices. \cChupInventor{} was the hardest. Why \cChupInventor{\does} \cChupInventor{\they} have so much security on \cChupInventor{\their} office anyway?

And lastly there is the matter of the graduation ceremony. At least tradition saves you having to hear from one of those stuck up 1st or 2nd fleet kids who are graduating. But you don’t particularly want to hear from \cWarlordDaughter{} either. \cWarlordDaughter{\Their} \cLoud{\parent}, \cLoud{\full} is the one leading the war effort. No one has suffered from the curses and trebuchets of the \pFarm{} and \pTech{} more than the pirates and others left on the margins of \pShip{} society. \cWarlordDaughter{} is as bad as any of them. By process of elimination, that leaves you to give the speech. All you have to do is convince \cMusic{} that you are the best choice.

This weekend will be a high stakes gamble, but if it pays off, you and the rest of the Silent Fog will be set for life. You just have to figure out if you are ready to say goodbye to all of your new friends, and discover the identity of your birth parent.


\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Find the undercover pirate, help them steal the properly attuned and powered up \iNet{}. Don’t let \iNet{} be used in the ritual.
	\item Find the parent that gave you up as a baby. The undercover pirate should be able to help with this.
	\item Keep the sea serpent a secret - more importantly, take care of it and keep it alive, it would be really awkward if the birthday gift for your friend were to die.
	\item Maintain appearances competing for the internship.
	\item Get chosen to give the Student Graduation speech. You can figure out what to actually say later.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are planning to find the undercover pirate by asking around using the phrase: ``the Waters untouched are not abandoned.’’ You expect the following response from the right person ``Those brave enough chart the course.’’ You will have to be careful though, many people do not like pirates, or even hate them. If the wrong person somehow knew the code phrases, or overheard you, it could blow everything.
	\item You have a strong phobia of fire, particularly open flames, but torches and even candles make you nervous.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cDisney{}} You were originally supposed to try to be \cDisney{\their} friend (and pretend if you had to), but you soon became actual friends.
	\contact{\cAdopted{}} Another friend who is helping you hide the sea serpent you brought \cDisney{} for \cDisney{\their} birthday.
	\contact{\cWildCard{}} The \pFarm{} noble \cWildCard{\person} who enabled your attendance at the \pSchool{} in exchange for an agreement to be \cDisney{}’s friend once you got here.
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} A teacher from the \pTech{} with a suspicious amount of security on \cChupInventor{\their} office.
\contact{\cChupLeader{}} Isn’t that the secretary for the Head Diplomat from the \pShip{}? You know \cChupLeader{} as the friendly face that helped you get registered for the \pSchool{} after you were selected.
\end{contacts}
