\name{\cHeadScientist{}}

You are \cHeadScientist{\full} (\cHeadScientist{\they}/\cHeadScientist{\them}), and 57 years old.  You are the premier scientist of \pTech{}, a position you've held for almost six years. You like to think of yourself as a combination of fun loving approachability and dedication to your work. This weekend you are attending the \pSchool{} as an Advisor, an event you'd been looking forward to until recent developments dashed any hope of positivity. Now you're in for a rough weekend, but at least you'll get to spend some time with your life long friend, \cChupInventor{\full}, so hopefully it won’t be a \textbf{total} loss.

As the head of the \pTech{} scientist's guild, you are leading the national effort to invent a way to permanently eliminate the magical Storms that have long ravaged the three nations of \pEarth{}.  You've been at the forefront of this mission since you took over the decade-long project six years ago. You and your team had been following several promising hypotheses as to the connection between magic as humans wield it, and the Storms themselves. You had hoped to uncover a common source. From there, you could devise a way to block the magic from funneling into the storm, while preserving the conduit to humanity. Unfortunately, things started to look concerning three months ago, and two weeks ago the last of a series of experiments dashed your remaining hopes. The layman's explanation for your findings is that the Storms are an inevitable part of magic, the same way that rain is an inevitable part of the water cycle. The Storms exist as long as magic exists. There is no way to end the Storms short of the permanent eradication of all Magic. Which is both impossible (it would be like stopping the rain from falling) and an untenable outcome. Not one iota of technology would work without magic. The \pTech{} would be reduced to rubbing sticks together and praying for fire. Would the Gods even listen if humanity rejected their greatest gift? You can't even begin to fathom the impact this knowledge would have on the war between the three nations, or on the all important treaty which has sheltered \pTech{} from the storm for the past six years.  

And what abominable timing!  You are tasked with presenting at the \pSchool{} this weekend, and when you reported the failure of the mission to your liaison on the Council you were ordered under no uncertain terms to lie, claim that it works, and that you have a solution. What a mess this is!  It's up to you to do the impossible and try to contain this issue while the Council determines the appropriate course for dealing with this news. You are already preparing for the inevitable damage control that's about to be your problem. On that front, you certainly hope to have at least some allies. The Faledon family representative \cDiplomat{\full} for one, \cAssistantScientist{\full} for another. Your assistant scientist, \cAssistantScientist{}, has almost as much to lose here as you do, so perhaps the two of you can put your heads together and collaborate on what story you are going to tell. Still, it's a risk. It's possible that \cAssistantScientist{\they} might try to shift blame entirely to your shoulders, saving \cAssistantScientist{\their} own career at the expense of yours, when in fact \cAssistantScientist{} has been one of the most prolific contributors despite not always doing quality work. The truth might have come to light sooner without \cAssistantScientist{\their} bumbling and you would have had more time to prepare. \cAssistantScientist{} showed up four years ago with impeccable credentials, but now you wonder if you should have dug into \cAssistantScientist{\their} job history a little more.

You'll have a far more solid ally in \cChupInventor{}. You last saw \cChupInventor{\them} six years ago, the last time you were at the \pSc{}, although you keep in frequent contact through letter writing. The two of you grew up together and could always rely on one another. It was your own research that supported \cChupInventor{\their} greatest invention: refrigeration coils. You were the one that convinced \cChupInventor{} to take the invention to the Temple. You were disappointed when they rejected it, but \cChupInventor{} was absolutely crushed. You have done your best over the years to try to support \cChupInventor{}, but \cChupInventor{\they} nurse\cChupInventor{\plural} a mean grudge against The Church to this day. You are increasingly concerned about how fixated \cChupInventor{} remains on this.

Six years ago, you were supporting \cChupInventor{} in a different way. You were a junior scientist then, brought along to the weekend at the \pSchool{} as a PR move. You were supposed to stand around, and look clever, and stay out of the way. But just before you traveled to the \pSc{}, an influential courtier from Children of the Sun named \cEvil{\full} approached you and made you an offer you couldn't refuse. You were given replicas of the magical stones used for voting, and tasked with swapping them in for the real stones before votes were distributed, then swapping the real stones back in after the votes were counted and the direction of the Storm determined. The fake stones would then be a huge source of unregulated magic that you could do with as you pleased. As further incentive, you were told that performing this task ``would work wonders for your career.'' You were hesitant, but you recognized an opportunity when you saw one and agreed. You completed the mission without getting caught, and soon learned the horrifying results – the treaty between the three nations broken, war with the \pShip{}, and the 12 students who had voted to direct the Storm mysteriously dead. You returned home with heavy heart, carrying the fake stones brimming with power from the 12 dead students, and gave them to \cChupInventor{} to empower some of \cChupInventor{\their} inventions even after being banned from the Temple. Even though you gave the stones away, the guilt of your actions weighs on you. But who could you possibly tell? So you've told no one; carrying that burden alone.

The rest of your payment for swapping out the stones soon came through – \cDiplomat{}, an important \pTech{} diplomat, promoted you to a high station in the scientist guild (one that someone of your background could never have achieved otherwise) and put you in charge of stopping the Storms. You were \emph{supposed} to be the greatest scientist in all of history\ldots{} but now you wonder if \cEvil{} and \cDiplomat{} haven't been laughing at you the whole time after the disastrous events that occurred with your help. Regardless, you have to steer anyone investigating what happened 6 years ago down some dead end or distract them. There is no denying your fingerprints are all over that mess, and losing your job would be the least of your worries if you get caught. Plus, \cChupInventor{} might go down with you, since \cChupInventor{\they} accepted the fake voting stone and as far as you know is still using them as power sources. 

So you've started looking for a way out. You wouldn't have expected the church to be your solution, but sometimes life takes you in unexpected directions. When \cBeetle{\full} wrote to you a few years ago inviting you to study with \cBeetle{\them}, you brushed the invitation off. But now that you think of it, if you were a \cHeadScientist{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}, you'd be somewhat protected from the legal system of the \pTech{}. Of course, \cBeetle{}'s Cleric position is only available if \cBeetle{\they} are selected as the next principal of the \pSc{}, so you need to make sure that happens. Otherwise, the best you could be is inducted as is an initiate; and initiates don't have nearly the same legal immunities. And 57 is a little late to enter the game -- you'll have to work very, very hard to convince \cAntiChup{\full} and \cBeetle{} that you actually want to become a \cHeadScientist{\cleric} for reasons beyond just saving your own skin, and are suited to the role.

Part of that convincing is working with \cEbbPriest{\full}. \cEbbPriest{} is a scholar and \pShip{} \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{} researching \pEarth{}'s creation story. \cBeetle{} has approved this as a project for you to work on to demonstrate your aptitude for this type of work. For some reason, one of the students, \cScholarship{\full}, also seems determined to assist with this research. Perhaps you should check with \cBeetle{} about that.

You haven't been back to the \pSc{} in six years. It feels a little surreal to be back, after you were whisked home and into your successful new life in the shadow of the deaths of 12 children. You were restless, so you wandered off through the gardens. As you wandered, you fiddled with some of your technology. You always carry many small projects with you. Most of them are novelties -- little more than fidget toys. But sometimes there really is no replacement for a self-mixing bowl and you are suddenly the most popular person in the room. On your way back to the rest of the \pTech{} contingent of Advisors, you (literally) ran into a stranger. \cChupAvenger{\They} introduced \cChupAvenger{\themself} as \cChupAvenger{\full}, gave you a warm smile, and waved off your apologies. As you continued on your way, you realized you felt a little lighter. \cChupAvenger{\Theyare} kind of cute; maybe \cChupAvenger{\they}'d be free for dinner sometime?

The last time you were at the College of the Gods, you didn't pay much attention to the role of advisor, but now you are older and wiser. You realize that the role advisors play in establishing voting authority can make or break a student's future career, and make or break international treaties. So you've taken a little time off of worrying about yourself to investigate the \pTech{} students who are staying for the Time of Deciding. You find yourself most impressed with \cTechStar{\full}, this past year's winner of the Tech Star Competition. Some might say that \cTechStar{\they} \cTechStar{\have} climbed as high as \cTechStar{\they} can go, having won a national competition and holding a seat on the council while not even 20, but that position is just for one year; you know that if \cTechStar{\they} ever want to get back there, \cTechStar{\they}'ll need a stellar record, which starts here at the college. You don't enjoy politicking, but you may need to have some discussions with your fellow advisors to ensure that \cTechStar{} comes out on top.

As if you didn't have enough on your plate, you've noticed lately that you seem to have some odd memory gaps. You have plenty of memories of working in the lab, but your personal life seems\ldots{} thinned out somehow. It is a vague, subtle, yet troubling feeling that you haven't quite been able to shake. Thus far, you've been attributing it to stress and your abysmal work/life balance, but this off-kilter feeling persists.

This weekend is probably going to be a disaster. You've got to keep a lid on the truth about the Storms for as long as possible, knowing full well that the ruse cannot last indefinitely and sooner or later you will need to switch to damage control. You've got to keep an eye on \cChupInventor{} and support your friend. And you've got to make sure your plan to hide behind the protection of the Priesthood is airtight. You aren't one to pray for luck, but you can certainly pray that \cTechGod{} grants you the skill and wisdom to see it all through.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Present the \pTech{} solution to the Storms on Saturday afternoon. Since there \textbf{is no solution}, this is likely to turn into ``manage the fallout'' very quickly.
	\item Solidify an escape plan, either through \cBeetle{} or another way, in case it becomes necessary. To escape through the Priesthood, you have to help \cBeetle{} win the Principalship so that \cBeetle{\their} cleric position opens up for you to fill. To convince \cBeetle{} and \cAntiChup{} of yor commitment to becoming a \cHeadScientist{\cleric} you need to work with \cEbbPriest{} on questions surrounding the creation of magic, humanity, and \pEarth{} itself.
	\item Keep anyone from investigating what happened to the students 6 years ago too closely.
	\item Make sure the Storm does not get sent to the \pTech{}. Convince your fellow \pTech{} advisors to rank \cTechStar{} highest for voting authority to direct the Storm.
	\item If time allows, get to know \cChupAvenger{} a bit. \cChupAvenger{\theyare} cute and feel\cChupAvenger{\plural}\ldots{} comfortable? safe? It is strange, but nice.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You were at the College of the Gods six years ago as an advisor, and were secretly tasked with swapping out the voting stones for fakes. You had no inkling of the terrible events that would follow until it was too late.
	\item You have a fancy ring that you've been carrying in your pocket. The eerie thing is, it is not properly sized for you and you have no idea where it came from. You considered getting rid of it, but for some unknown reason the thought of doing so brings tears to your eyes and an ache to your heart. 
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cAssistantScientist{}} Your primary assistant. \cAssistantScientist{} is both your greatest ally and greatest liability in keeping the fact that you can't get rid of the storms under wraps. If the two of you work together, you might both get out of this with your skins intact, if not your reputations. If you throw \cAssistantScientist{} under the cart, you might come out unscathed. But if \cAssistantScientist{\they} does it to you\ldots{}
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} Your closest friend for most of your life. \cChupInventor{} is a brilliant inventor, but \cChupInventor{\their} greatest invention was stymied by the Church. You aren't sure if you should continue to enable \cChupInventor{\their} grudge.
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} The \cBeetle{\cleric} who has offered to train you as a \cHeadScientist{\cleric}. It's not a terrible escape plan for when things go sideways with the science.
	\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} The head scholar on the creation myth project. You haven't met in person before, but \cEbbPriest{\they} seem\cEbbPriest{\plural} competent, albeit a little stern, and a bit of a stickler for rules.
	\contact{\cEvil{}} The person who gave you the fake voting stones. Since realizing the Storms cannot be stopped without the complete destruction of magic, (which is impossible anyway), you sometimes wonder idly if it wasn't all some big trick played on you.
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} A senior diplomat from the \pTech{} and the primary patron of your research into ending the Storms. You have not yet told \cDiplomat{\them} that there is no way to end the Storms. You know you need to bring \cDiplomat{\them} up to speed soon so \cDiplomat{\they} can help with damage control, but you are dreading that conversation\ldots{}
	\contact{\cTechStar{}} This year's Tech Star, and the \pTech{} student whom you think should receive the most votes to direct the Storm.
	\contact{\cScholarship{}} A student who seems very eager to help you and \cEbbPriest{} with the research into the creation of \pEarth{}.
\end{contacts}
