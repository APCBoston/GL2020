%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the character's current life, problems, and priorities. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life. Current life and situation.   What they think about the most important contacts

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.

Eleanor
Knows David is manipulative and mildly evil and is opposed to him being on the throne
Knows that the Queen is also secretly super manipulative and offs people who opposes her (or curses them with horrible things)
Wants for someone else to succeed the throne (the person who is already in line) - actively working on discrediting David
How does Eleanor know that the signet ring is missing?
She doesnâ€™t know at start that it is the seal
She hears David whining/ranting to himself about how he has lost something very important and he must find it to reclaim his honor / redeem himself in the eyes of his family when thought he was alone
She sets herself on a mission to find out what it is and find it first so that he will be discredited and out of favor
The black market is a good place to start looking for anything that is lost
