\name{\cAdopted{}}

You are \cAdopted{\full}, (\cAdopted{\they}/\cAdopted{\them}).  At 19 years old, you are a First Year student at \pSchool{}.  You grew up in the \pFarm{}, but your family life is\ldots{} complicated.  Forcibly adopted into a noble family at a young age, you yearn to undo the despicable norms in your country that led to your kidnapping by the Nobility who could supposedly provide better for you than those who truly love you, and you'll do anything to find your true family. You are determined to punish the ones who took you, and use the great magical potential that you were born with to better the lives of the farming families across \pFarm{} whether the \cQueen{\Majesty} and the Nobility like it or not.

You were born into a poor family that farmed the lands under the rule of \cAdoptedParentOne{\full}, but when your magical potential was discovered you were promptly ``adopted'' into the Noble \cAdoptedParentOne{\formal} family. Your new so-called family told you it was for your own best interest and that they could give you a life and education that your birth family could never provide.  In reality, you never felt truly included - your new siblings made it clear to you that you were there for your magical potential alone and your other relatives always treated you as second best. Never did they make you feel truly loved, like a real family would. You hate the people who kept you from your true family and the love and belonging you've craved all your life, and you've got plans for revenge.  

After so many years apart from your birth family and in the hands of people who never truly loved you, you are starved for the feeling of connection and being a part of something. You've felt this sense of something missing all of your life, but have never had an outlet for it. Out from under your adopted family's careful watch for the first time, this has led to the increasingly strong desire to reconnect with your birth family and repudiate your kidnappers. You know that \cAdoptedParentOne{} would never approve, and the rest of the family would conspire to prevent you from doing so, so you must work in secret. You have heard rumors of these things called ``vid-com'' devices in the \pTech{}. These devices are not yet available to the general public even in the \pTech{}, but allow for communication between two people who each hold one of these devices. If only you could get your hands on a pair, you could keep one for yourself, and smuggle one to your birth family. Finding such items when they aren't generally available will be tricky - you'll probably have to find a way to access the black market. And then there's the matter of money. While you aren't exactly hurting for pocket money, you suspect that the black market is likely to trade on things other than \pFarm{} currency. You are more than prepared to sell curses, break rules, or take on personal sacrifice to make this happen.

After you have the devices, all you need to do is find your birth family (in epilogue) to give them one of the devices -- and convince them to take them, keep them secret, and love you again. That part might be more of a long term project\ldots{} They have to want to do that, though, right? After all, if you can't belong with them, there isn't anywhere else you really belong\ldots{} right? The desire to be with your birth family again is like an ache in your chest, but you know you should keep your eye out for any other community you might be able to belong to -- because if this doesn't work, you don't know WHAT you'll do.

Beyond the immediate goals of finding and communicating with your birth family, you feel driven to improve the lives of your family and all those like them, who are so often ignored, neglected, or abused by the Nobility. Healing magic, which comes in the form of enchanted music, is strictly regulated by the Priesthood, and usually only licensed to be distributed by Clerics. If only you could devise a way to record the healing music and get it into the hands of the farmers who truly need it, you could improve the lives of so many -- even save lives the next time the Storms hit the \pFarm{} again!  The nobility remain safe within their walls, a dedicated Cleric always on hand, while those who actually \emph{work} \cFarmGod{}'s land face the Storms unprotected. You won't let the fact that these ideas are ``heretical''  stop you.

That is where \cMusic{\full} comes in. \cMusic{} is the music teacher, and also happens to be the aunt of your adoptive ``father.'' \cMusic{\Their} music class is your favorite class. \cMusic{} has taught at the \pSchool{} almost since you were born; certainly since before you were ``adopted.'' So \cMusic{\they} \cMusic{\were} never around. Maybe that's just as well because no matter how nice \cMusic{\theyare} to you know, \cMusic{\theyare} part of the power structure that kidnapped you from your birth family, even if \cMusic{\they}claim\cMusic{\plural} to be helpless to influence your adoptive ``father'' to reunite you with your real family. But recruiting \cMusic{} to the cause of sharing healing music with the masses could turn out to be crucial to your success. You'll have to tread carefully, since many adults will likely look askance at what you are trying to do, including \cMusic{} \cMusic{\them}self, and \cHedonist{}, the \cHedonist{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{}. 

Even if you do succeed in enlisting \cMusic{}'s help, you'll still need a way to mass produce the music. For that, you hope to gain the help of the \cHeir{\formal} Family – a wealthy, powerful family from the \pTech{}. \cHeir{\full} is a fellow student, and with \cHeir{\their} support, surely the \cHeir{\formal}s would take up your cause. If \cHeir{} proves reluctant, you could always try going through \cAmbition{}, \cHeir{}'s best friend. You know that \cDiplomat{\full} will also be here, and \cDiplomat{\they} \cDiplomat{\have} worked with the \cHeir{\formal}s for many years, but approaching \cDiplomat{\them} without \cHeir{}'s support feels too intimidating. You also think the Combat teacher, \cInterpol{\full}, might be willing to help. \cInterpol{\They} have a lot of sympathy for your very reasonable fear of being hurt in combat class.

You also have one more, somewhat more sinister goal -- getting revenge for the wrongs done to you by your kidnappers. With the help of your best friend \cLibAssist{\full}, you've come up with a plan to curse your entire adoptive family's line with a wasting curse. This curse will render food tasteless, bland, and most importantly, devoid of nutrition. Until you decide to lift the curse, the entirety of the \cAdopted{\formal} family above the age of 15 will slowly waste away, despite their best efforts, and perish after months or years of agony. You don't intend to actually let them die, though -- just make them confront their own helplessness in the face of a greater power, just like you have had to, and perhaps provide you some concessions in order to release them. The arrival and assistance of \cCurse{}, who is a commoner just like you, will provide a key component of your plan, and is the biggest reason you have to complete it this weekend; the College's resident curse expert, \cPrince{\Heir} \cPrince{}, is Children of the Sun royalty, and therefore unlikely to be sympathetic to your cause. The biggest wrinkle in this plan is that your kidnappers are, of course, related to \cMusic{} and now that you've had the chance to get to know \cMusic{\them}, you find you like \cMusic{\them} very much. As such, you've gone to significant trouble to start the preparations for a counterspell for \cMusic{\them} that can shield one person from the effects of the curse. No need to punish the good with the bad.

Of course, to hold on to any advances you make, and to make it through the defeat of your ``adoptive family,'' you'll need to start building your own base of authority outside of them. Many of the most powerful and successful people in the \pFarm{} are alumni of the \pSchool{}. Having the most votes among the \pFarmers{} students would indicate that you have the favor of the teachers, the advisors, and \cFarmGod{} \cFarmGod{\them}self. You'd be well on your way to carving out a place for yourself in \pFarm{} society, from which you could implement all kinds of improvements. Which is to say nothing of how much peace of mind it would give you to be able to personally direct the Storm away from your home. The current frontrunner, \cChupStudent{}, is dull, lazy, and unworthy of the position. Even if you can sympathize with the occasional flashes of anti-establishment sentiment \cChupStudent{\they} let\cChupStudent{\plural} slip sometimes, \cChupStudent{\they}\cChupStudent{\re} a perfect example of everything wrong with the \pFarm{} -- a lazy noble who still gets to be on top just because of \cChupStudent{\their} family name. You intend to give \cChupStudent{\them} a rude awakening and win the most votes for yourself.

As it turns out, you are not the only one at the school trying to escape a toxic guardianship. You've been connecting recently with one of your classmates, \cScholarship{\full}. Normally sort of a loner, \cScholarship{\they} \cScholarship{\have} opened up to you about how much \cScholarship{\they} can't stand and want\cScholarship{\plural} to get away from \cScholarship{\their} \cAntiChup{\cleric} mentor, \cAntiChup{\full}, who is always making \cScholarship{} do \cAntiChup{\their} dirty work. \cScholarship{} hasn't gone into details, but you get the impression that the ``dirty work'' is often unethical, maybe even illegal. You deeply empathize with \cScholarship{\their} plight and recognize a fellow good person caught in a bad situation, determined to escape from it by any means necessary. It dawned on you just the other day that your feelings go beyond compassion and respect — you are crushing on \cScholarship{\them} pretty hard. You haven't told  \cScholarship{} yet and are still deciding what you want to do, but a part of you is desperate to find out if \cScholarship{\they} return your feelings.

And then there is the matter of your friends \cDisney{\full} and \cPirateChild{\full}. They approached you a few weeks ago with a ridiculous dilemma. The two of them had gotten ahold of a sea serpent egg, and actually decided to keep and hatch it! You can't leave those two alone for 5 seconds before they manage something preposterous. The magically inclined members of your ``adopted'' family specialize in charms of protection, primarily illusions of the highest quality that make one thing look like another. Willingly or not, you learned the family trade, and are adept both at creating such charms and spotting them on objects, though breaking such enchantments is something you are still practicing. To keep \cDisney{} and \cPirateChild{} from getting in trouble, you agreed to use your magic to disguise the sea serpent egg as a stuffed animal. The illusion took a week to make and cast. But now it has hatched! Casting illusions on living things is -much- harder, and takes even longer. The illusions also don't last nearly as long (not fair), and anything the creature does will be modeled in the illusion. Your stuffed animal illusion has already faded, so it's best to keep the sea serpent hatchling hidden in a secret compartment behind one of the bookcases in the student lounge for now.

All in all, despite the various obstacles and troubles, you're hopeful that you'll be able to make meaningful connections with your real family, improve their lives with healing magic, and punish those who have wronged you.  All you've got to do is survive the storm, and not get kicked out for helping to hide a sea serpent.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Finalize the Curse against your kidnappers and ensure that \cMusic{} will be immune.
	\item Acquire a pair of ``vid-com'' devices so you can reconnect with your birth family.
	\item Create a way to record music that will retain its healing magic, to make healing more widely available to the masses.
	\item Find a place to belong.
	\item Win the most voting authority from among the \pFarmers{} students. Make sure that the Storm does not get directed at the \pFarm{}.
	\item Decide what to do about your romantic feelings for \cScholarship{}, and see if there is some way you can help \cScholarship{\them} escape \cScholarship{\their} terrible mentor \cAntiChup{}.
	\item Help \cPirateChild{} and \cDisney{} with the newly hatched sea serpent baby.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are a first year student.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cMusic{}} The Music teacher, and extended family to your ``adopted'' family. \cMusic{\They} will be hit  by the curse too unless you can do something to stop it; and while \cMusic{} can be a little annoying, \cMusic{\they} \cMusic{\does}n't deserve to be cursed.
	\contact{\cLibAssist{}} Your best friend and accomplice in the plot to curse your family.
	\contact{\cPirateChild{}} Your reckless friend. Smuggled a sea serpent egg into the school as a gift for \cDisney{}.
	\contact{\cDisney{}} Your idealistic friend. Received a sea serpent egg as a birthday gift from \cPirateChild{}, which has now hatched!
	\contact{\cScholarship{}} A student from the Free People's Federation whom you have been connecting with over having toxic guardians you both want to escape from. \cScholarship{\They} also happens to be super cute and you find yourself developing romantic feelings for \cScholarship{\them}.
	\contact{\cInterpol{}} The Magical Combat teacher, whom you think might be sympathetic to your goal of making magical healing available to the masses without reliance on the Priesthood.
	\contact{\cHeir{}} A fellow student, and heir to the powerful \cHeir{\formal} family, a top manufacturer in the \pTech{}. You hope to convince \cHeir{}, perhaps through \cHeir{\their} friend \cAmbition{} or mentor \cDiplomat{}, to get \cHeir{\their} family to help you mass produce a device that can store healing magic and release it on demand.
