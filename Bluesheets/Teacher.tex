Only the best of the best are invited to teach at the \pSchool{}. Being a teacher at the \pSc{} is a tremendous honor and a tremendous responsibility. It is also a careful balancing act. You are ostensibly neutral, having shed any national ties when you accepted the teaching position here. Some few teachers make a serious effort to actually achieve impartiality -- but most retain close contacts via correspondence, and keep careful tabs on domestic and international politics.

Those of the staff who stay at the \pSc{} during the Time of Deciding have a multifaceted challenge ahead. You must prepare the Ritual to Control the Storm, lest the magic get out of hand and do even more damage than a controlled Storm would. You must guide the students, and provide a buffer between them and the Advisors, who often forget that the students are people unto themselves. You must preserve the veneer of impartiality. And you must weigh its value against the very real risk that people dear to you could die if the Storm is sent to your home nation.

You are not in this alone. Every teacher at the Time of Deciding is trying to find the same balance. You can and should be a resource for each other as you navigate this time. All of you have been colleagues for years, some for decades. Who better to hold your moments of doubt than another teacher, or the immortal Principal? But it's probably best if the students don't hear you doubting. They look up to you for assurance and stability.

You will almost certainly need to field concerns around the ethics and morality of one decision or another. You may find yourself questioning, or be called on to defend the traditions of the \pSc{}, the nations, and the religion. How will you support your favorite students? How will you protect your homeland? And how will you make \pEarth{} a better place?

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Decide among the teachers from your nation how you will rank the students from your nation for the purposes of who will receive the most voting tokens. Principal \cPrincipal{} may be a tie-breaking vote if necessary. Submit the list by 9 pm on Saturday night.
	\item Prepare the Ritual to Control the Storm. A few teachers, \cFlowPriest{}, \cMusic{}, \cHistory{}, \cLibrarian{}, and \cBeetle{} have been put in charge of ensuring this vital task is completed. If you find yourself with free time, you should seek them out and offer to help.
	\item Execute your parts in the Ritual to Control the Storm.
	\item Attend the graduation ceremony to support the students.
	\item Preserve the school, and its traditions.
\end{itemz}
