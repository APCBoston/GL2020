\name{\cEvil{}}

You are \cEvil{} (\cEvil{\they}/\cEvil{\them}), and <> years old. You are an advisor to \cQueen{\full}, and here to forward a number of your own plans. If ever the term “evil mastermind” applied, it would apply to you. Maybe you didn’t start off that way, but after a lifetime of playing that game, you’ve come to recognize just how good at it you are.

You are the youngest son of a mid-level nobility in \pFarm{}. Growing up, your prospects were modest at best, since you would inherit no land unless you took your fate into your own hands. To that end, you immersed yourself in the brutal politics of the \cQueen{\Majesty}’s court. There something wonderful happened, and then something terrible.

You met \cPirateChildParent{} and fell in love. Unfortunately you also met \cEvilNemesis{}. \cEvilNemesis{} was incredibly powerful in \pFarm{}, and took an instant disliking to you. The two of you fought on many fronts for several years. More than once \cEvilNemesis{\they} nearly killed you, or disgraced your family, or some other equally terrible outcome. But one day, \cEvilNemesis{\they} went too far. Not six months after \cPirateChildParent{} had given birth to a baby \cPirateChild{\kid}, \cEvilNemesis{} vowed to kill your family, and then nearly did so by setting your house on fire. You only just saved your \cPirateChild{\child}, but could not save your \cPirateChildParent{\spouse}.

Realizing how dangerous your nemesis was, you made a decision you knew was necessary, but still regret every day of your life. To protect your \cPirateChild{\child}, you gave them away. Through a series of contacts, you gave the child to \cEthics{}, and asked \cEthics{\them} to pass the child on to a family somewhere you could never find. Your \cPirateChild{\child} was safe, but \cPirateChild{\they} \cPirateChild{\were} also gone from your life forever.

Eight years ago, after 10 years of trying to rid yourself of \cEvilNemesis{}, you finally succeeded. You were now one of the most powerful members of the \pFarm{}, at least as far as soft political power went. You started to look beyond your own borders, and began collaborating with \cDiplomat{} who had quite the grand plan. \cDiplomat{\They} approached you to assist with a grand scheme to end the storm entirely - \cDiplomat{\they} just needed your help buying a little time by directing the Storm at \pShip{} out of turn.

The world would be a much better place without the storms - anyone can see that. So you tapped some contacts, and had some duplicates of the voting stones made. You gave those to \cHeadScientist{}. But then you realized that \cDiplomat{} didn’t plan far enough ahead. Sure you could rig the election to send the storm to \pShip{}, but the students would know. So you made arrangements to clean up loose ends. A few words in the right ears and you had yourself an assassin willing to poison the wine used for the celebratory toast. And just like that, all 12 students were dead, and there was no one to discover what you and the others had done.

Fast forward to today, and it's a whole different host of problems. The biggest is \cLoud{\full}. The warlord is the lynchpin on which the \pShip{} war effort hinges. If \cLoud{\they} could be assasinated, the \pShip{} would soon fall under the collective might of the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}. Ironically enough, the key to bringing \cLoud{} low lies in their \cWarlordDaughter{\child} being at \pSchool{}. You have already set in motion using \cWarlordDaughter{\them} as leverage to get the warlord to show \cLoud{\themself} at a known location so you can send an assassin after them.

In addition to your numerous other projects, you are also hopeful that you’ll be able to snare the lofty position of Principal of \pSchool{}.  Naturally, you have submitted a very robust, albeit slightly falsified resume to \cPrincipal{}, detailing your work as principal of a smaller school, and you are now in the running for the position.  \cPrincipal{} would of course prefer to hire \cMusic{} or \cBeetle{}, both of whom have been teaching at \pSc{} for years, but you are confident you can find ways to ensure that they don’t live up to \cPrincipal{}’s scrutiny and secure the position yourself.

Whether you ultimately win the position of Principal or not, it’s high time you trained yourself a protege. You have quietly made contact with three students at the \pSc{}, \cPirateChild{}, \cLibAssist{}, and \cAmbition{}, who you have identified as viable candidates. They are all clever and walk the dangerous edge of morality to get what they want. You’ve set a series of tasks for them, related to hindering your various enemies.

You have enemies of course, quite a lot of them at this point. \cInterpol{} is a pain in your ass. \cInterpol{\They} are always nosing in your business, supposedly by coincidence. And now \cInterpol{} is here at the \pSc{}. Inconvenient to say the least. As for \cDiplomat{}, well the two of you have lots of history of collaborating, but that really just means that you both have dirt on each other. You intend to gain the upper hand in this power struggle, to ensure that if anything you’ve done together where to come out, you could pin it all on \cDiplomat{} and get away scot free. Lastly, there is \cJuniorStatesman{}. It’s not so much that you hate \cJuniorStatesman{} personally, but that \cJuniorStatesman{\their} family has been opposed to your family for generations, and you have every reason to believe they’re connected with pirates, if not pirates themselves. Any chance to strike back against that family is not to be missed.

You are also intrigued by the fact that a little birdy told you \cCurse{} and \cFlowPriest{} have been in constant correspondence working to enchant some magic beans, of all things, which, as far as you’ve learned might go so far as to open a path to the world of the Gods!  Obviously, once the enchantments on them are completed, they would hold enormous value.

A little closer to home is your relationship with \cPrince{}. The two of you work together sometimes, and you are even willing to admit that you appreciate \cPrince{\their} company, and respect their scheming mind. You have invested serious resources in facilitating \cPrince{\their} rise to power and would be loath to lose them unless it is your obvious advantage. It should serve both of your ends that you are here at \pSchool{}, where \cPrince{} is currently teaching and can collaborate in person. 

Still, \cPrince{} appears to have run into some sort of trouble of late. Word among your agents is that \cPrince{\their} royal seal might have been\ldots liberated from \cPrince{\their} possession. Such artifacts are incredibly powerful, and even aside from what you could do with it yourself, the \cQueen{\Majesty} would reward you handsomely for returning it - at the very least with lands and a title of your own, which would secure your legacy. You could of course also give it back to \cPrince{}, if \cPrince{\they} could offer you something more valuable for it. 

Still, it is not your practice to put the horse before the cart - first you have to find the damn thing. And such a powerful artifact is sure to have a protective charm on it that will make it difficult or impossible to recognize. You may need to recruit someone with the proper\ldots skills to find the seal without anyone being the wiser.

There’s much to accomplish, and little time in which to do it all, but you are brilliant to say the least.  No one can manipulate a situation to their own ends quite like you can, so you expect to be quite successful indeed.  By the end of the weekend you’ll have been named Principal, acquired for yourself a few choice items of power, and made your enemies lives a living hell.  You can practically taste the victories.


\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Become Principal by sabotaging the efforts of \cMusic{} and \cBeetle{}.
	\item Get your candidate apprentices to harass your enemies. String them along as long as they are assisting you, but be sure to pick one before the weekend is over.
\item Assassinate the \pShippies{} Warlord.
\item Acquire the \pFarm{} royal Seal, after figuring out what it actually is.
\item Steal the \iBeans{} after their enchantment is completed, but before they are planted so you can bring them back with you to \pFarm{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} You’ve collaborated with \cDiplomat{} on several projects, the biggest was redirecting the storm to the \pShip{} 6 years ago. You were the one that covered up the tracks.

\contact{\cPrincipal{}} The current principal of the school. You are looking to take over \cPrincipal{\their} job.
\contact{\cInterpol{}} has a nasty habit of knowing too much of your business, and you’re sure there’s more to \cInterpol{\them} than meets the eye.
\contact{\cJuniorStatesman{}} A member of a hated family of \pShippies{}. Pirates, or no better than them.
