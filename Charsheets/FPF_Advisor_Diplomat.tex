%%Ev AKA Ev Schauer AKA FPF Advisor Diplomat

You are \cDiplomat{} (\cDiplomat{\they}/\cDiplomat{\them}), foremost Diplomat of \pTech{}, attending the \pSchool{} on this important weekend as an Advisor.  At the core of your success is your single guiding principle -- loyalty to your nation and its interests above all else. When you speak, others listen, and the weight of the governing Council and your Faledon connection grants power to your words. This weekend there is nobody attending with a more solid position than your own -- or at least that’s the impression you’d like to give off. Privately though, it’s beginning to be a bit of a stretch to keep everything from falling to pieces. People just can’t seem to be satisfied leaving important matters in your capable hands, and just have to make a nuisance of themselves. But you aren’t the most powerful diplomat in the three nations for nothing, and there’s no way you’re going to let people wrest control from your grip.

You’ve accomplished great things in the last few years, but the accomplishment - as well as the horror - of six years ago looms largest in your mind.  In the defining moment of your career and the deal that made your name, you established an unprecedented treaty with \pFarm{} and cemented an alliance, turning your two nations against the \pShip{} for the ultimate benefit of all.  This treaty dictates that the Storm shall henceforth always be directed towards the \pShip{}.  \pFarm{} will grant significant deals to your own nation on food and goods, and in exchange \pTech{} has devoted its resources and best scientists, including \cHeadScientist{}, to developing technology that will permanently eradicate the Storm itself.  But this auspicious event was tainted by the deaths of the entire group of students who voted to control the Storm, including \cHeirSibling{}, who had been Heir to the Faledon family prior to this unfortunate event. You weren’t involved in the deaths of course -- not directly, at least. But the crime came right on the heels of you contracting \cEvil{} to rig the vote 6 years ago in order to buy \cHeadScientist{} time to find a way to end the storm (at \cHeadScientist{}’s request). The death of all of those students certainly accomplished that effectively -- but at a horrifying cost.

Regardless of the lack of proof, the timing has since caused you to fall under suspicion. Not that anyone would dare show their suspicion to your face, but\ldots you swear you can emph{feel} them thinking it. You’ll need to keep a sharp eye out for anyone looking into the deaths of the students six years ago, since it’s perfectly possible that you could be implicated in that. Of course, you’ll want to seemingly support any investigation, as it’s the just thing to do -- but behind the scenes, you’ll need to see that it goes nowhere. Of course, you won’t be emph{lying} when you say you don’t know who the culprit was. After all, you have very studiously found no proof of \cEvil{}’s crimes.

Gossip and rumor are simply the norm for one as powerful as yourself. Unfortunately, so are assasination attempts, sadly. You’re pretty sure just about everyone in \pShip{} would like to see you dead, but there’s one person here that you know has been trying to murder you for years - the teacher named \cChupAvenger{}. For whatever reason, \cChupAvenger{} has been attempting to assassinate you since the start of the war, and evading your every attempt to end \cChupAvenger{\their} life in return. It would be one thing if this were a political assassination attempt from \pShip{} to avenge your role in starting the war -- that could be dealt with using your full resources. But it didn’t take much digging to verify that \cChupAvenger{} isn’t backed by \pShip{}, or even \pFarm{} -- and that gave you pause. The lack of affiliation with a foreign power made it much less likely that this was motivated by your role in the treaty -- and much more likely to be motivated by personal revenge for the death of the students 6 years ago. As such, you have opted to keep your blood feud with \cChupAvenger{} under wraps for the weekend, and simply attempt to avoid contact of any kind. Such matters are unfortunate, but the truth of the matter is that such nuisances are the price to be paid for your accomplishments -- and thus far it’s been well worth it. It will be hard for anyone to kill you in such a visible setting as this weekend will be, but it always pays to keep one eye on your back. 

On a happier note, you are about to see something come to fruition that you’ve been working on for a long time -- a union between \cHeir{}, current heir to the Faledon household and younger \cHeir{\sibling} of the late \cHeirSibling{}, to \cChupStudent{}, \cChupStudent{\child} of a highly regarded noble family from the \pFarm{}. \cChupStudent{}’s family is close to the crown and holds a crucial territory adjoining the border with the \pTech{}. Getting them to agree to marrying off their second born \cChupStudent{\child} to the Faledons was a stroke of political genius. With this connection forged, the Faledons can finally get a strong foothold in the \pFarm{} and start expanding their influence -- and by extension, yours -- internationally. \cHeir{} has, as usual, been rebellious about the whole thing, but that’s not particularly new. 

You’ve known \cHeir{\them} all \cHeir{\their} life, and \cHeir{\they} \cHeir{\are} constantly complaining about having no control over \cHeir{\their} choices or dragging \cHeir{\their} feet around family business. It’s exasperating, to say the least! That’s why this time you’ve come prepared. You’ve gotten both of their families to organize a surprise wedding, and have delivered them letters just this morning informing them of such. This closing of the trap all at once was a well-played move on your end -- but something about the way \cHeir{} reacted to the news left you with a nagging feeling that something wasn’t quite right. You had better make sure that \cHeir{} doesn’t try anything funny, and that \cHeir{\they} uphold the Faledon family’s dignity.  A wedding should also help keep \cHeir{} distracted from digging up any uncomfortable truths about the death of \cHeirSibling{}.

Of course, the most important event of the weekend, far surpassing weddings and investigations, will be the Ritual to control the Storm. You’re responsible for one of the Relics, the \iMirror{}, which is attuned to your nation. While this Relic has rarely been used historically, as the \iLariat{} is the preferred Relic to represent the Free People, it’s still an honor to be the bearer of the Mirror and bring it to the \pSc{}. While it’s mainly here as a backup, it’s still your task to see that it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands and become de-attuned. And, even more importantly, it is your responsibility as an Advisor to ensure that the right student votes.  Naturally, you’ll see to it that \cHeir{} holds the premier position in the ritual and votes to direct the Storm to the \pShip{}, in order to uphold your treaty with \pFarm{}. Although \cHeir{} has always been somewhat of a lazy, disinterested child, \cHeir{\they} have generally done as you directed in the past. You haven’t seen \cHeir{\them} since \cHeir{\they} started at \pSchool{} a couple of years ago, and you hope for the sake of the Faledon family’s business interests that \cHeir{\they have} matured some in the interim.  

On that note, \cFaledonParent{} has asked you, in your frequent role as \cFaledonParent{\their} representative, to perform a brief ritual this weekend.  Now that \cHeir{} has come of age and will be graduating soon, you will pass on the Heir’s Seal stamp so that \cHeir{} can begin conducting family business under \cFaledonParent{}’s guidance once school is finished.  You’re hoping to get this out of the way by Saturday night, since Sunday will be so busy with more important matters, specifically the Ritual to control the Storm.

Speaking of treaties, you’ve been informed recently that certain parties, specifically \cHeadDiplomat{}, premier Diplomat of the \pShip{}, are trying to broker a ceasefire to end the war between the nations. While this effort is commendable in principle, in reality this is likely to result in disaster, as any new treaty ending the hostilities would inevitably be bought at the price of your own treaty being abolished -- which that would mean that the Storm could again be pointed at \pTech{}. Such an occurrence would be devastating for your nation, as there has been no preparation done, such as retrofitting of shelters, stockpiling of emergency response equipment, or any of the other vital work that a nation must do to safeguard its people against the ravages of the Storm. Such expensive and time consuming work was stopped as part of the treaty you brokered, so that the resources could be diverted towards the more permanent solution of ending the Storm for good. \pFarm{} is similarly unprepared to receive the devastation of the Storm cutting a swath through significant portions of their vital crop land. Such a thing would inevitably cause them to hoard their supplies, and this would in turn bring famine to your own people. It has been your life’s work to protect your beloved nation from the Storm, and you have succeeded. Your people have thrived in the safety you have earned them, and the casualties of war are paltry in comparison. There is no way you are going to let \cHeadDiplomat{} or anyone else broker a ceasefire that would ultimately threaten your people.  There are other ways to end a war, and you intend to make use of those.

The most crucial step in ending this war the right way is to eliminate the leader of the \pShip{} war efforts. \cLoud{}, probably seen as a hero by the \pShippies{}, is a warmongering murderer bent on the destruction of your homeland and the \pFarm{} alike, and should be disposed of immediately. You’ve learned that \cEvil{}, your co-conspirator of six years ago who arranged to control the votes to direct the storm, is interested in facilitating such a\ldots removal.  As much as you are not a fan of \cEvil{\their} methods, and \cEvil{\their} suspected involvement in the deaths of the students, you make it a policy never to set aside a useful tool -- and \cEvil{} is definitely that. Your nation comes first, whatever the cost, and you’ll do whatever you can to aid \cEvil{} in this task and ensure the success of this mission.

They say there is no rest for the weary, and that will certainly be true for you this weekend!  But you are used to juggling numerous political and social intrigues with ease, and have no doubt that your experience and guile will win out in the end.  You’ll ensure \cHeir{} is married off and voting according to the treaty, arrange the assassination of \cLoud{}\ldots all while ensuring that nobody links you with the death of the students six years ago.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Prevent people, and especially \cHeir{}, from digging too deep into the deaths of the students six years ago, while making it seem like you support such investigations.
	\item Ensure \cHeir{} gets voting authority - and that \cHeir{\they} vote\cHeir{\plural} for the Storms to go to \pShip{}.
	\item Arrange the assassination \cLoud{} alongside of \cEvil{}
	\item Ensure \cHeir{}’s wedding to \cChupStudent{} goes off without a hitch
	\item Conduct the ritual with \cHeir{} to pass down the Heir’s Seal stamp
	\item Ensure the \iMirror{} remains safe and attuned to \pTech{} 
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cEvil{}} is a fellow diplomat from \pFarm{} - talented at what he does, but with highly questionable morals and methods.
\contact{\cHeir{}} is the current lazy, unmotivated, troublesome Heir of the Faledon family. If only \cHeir{\they} had the drive of \cHeir{\their} older sibling\ldots
\contact{\cChupStudent{}} is \cHeir{}’s future spouse. The child of a powerful \pFarm{} family along the border with \pTech{}, \cChupStudent{\they} \cChupStudent{\are} an excellent addition to the Faledon family.
\contact{\cChupAvenger{}} appears to have it out for you - perhaps \cChupAvenger{\they} suspect\cChupAvenger{\plural} that you were involved in the murder of the students six years ago?  In any case, you’ll need to watch your back.

\cDiplomat{} doesn't want an investigation into the murdered students because she thinks it will get pinned on her because it was perhaps a result of the treaty.  \cDiplomat{} worked with Eric to rig vote, sent him Marie to help, but then Eric killed the kids, to \cDiplomat{}'s and Marie's surprise.

Schauer is going to be suspected of sending an assassin to kill the Lead Diplomat (NPC) who isn't at game because they're an amnesiac now, maybe because they killed the assassin in self defense?  Schauer is LOUDLY opposed to the ceasefire, which is what will cause her being a suspect in game.
