%Aaron AKA WR Advisor ChupLeader 

You are \cChupLeader{\full} (\cChupLeader{\they}/\cChupLeader{\them}), and the inspiring, visionary, charismatic leader of the \pGoaties{}. This is your moment to elevate your patron god \cGenesis{} to the level of the patron Gods of each of the countries, as well as liberate the world from the corrupting influence of magic. All you have to do is a few taboo rituals -- and not get caught doing them, before the weekend ends.

You grew up in \pShip{}, in the 9th fleet. Ninth fleet is one of the poorest parts of the country, despite bordering \pFarm{}. The trade was bad, the fishing was bad - just about everything was bad. You attended 9th fleet academy - if you could even call that bottom-of-the-barrel place an academy, worthless as the credentials are. You and your family scraped by -- but just barely. Many of your friends; and even more of your family, never had enough to eat. So much for a country of balance. Where was the spot at the banquet table for you and yours?

From a very young age, you stayed up late into the night, asking any deity who would listen why, WHY this was your lot in life? You were smart, charismatic, and talented! Yet because of where you were born, you were left to languish on the bottom rung of society. Long nights of contemplation brought you to realize that the reason for your pain was distressingly simple. The richer, more prosperous fleets had the resources to attract the best mages, who brought more wealth to the fleets that employed them. The mages strengthened the fleets and their social and financial position, intermingled, and gave birth to more strong mages, who stayed with those fleets. The self perpetuating system gave rise to closed circles of society that could never be breached -- with you on the outside. Looking abroad gave you no hope; this pattern was present the world over, no matter how meritocratic a country claimed to be. And at its very heart was \emph{magic}, the great unbalancer, the force that allowed this unjust system to perpetuate with no hope of revolution. The force with which the world could never be at peace. For years, you stewed in the problem, able to do nothing to change your plight or that of so many others\ldots

But that all changed suddenly, just over 10 years ago. Deep in the night, you heard a voice whisper in the dark. It was a quiet voice at first, A voice of something afraid to be caught where it was not welcome. After you listened for a moment, you recognized it for what it was -- the savior you had been looking for. The \cGenesis{\God} called \cGenesis{} was speaking directly in your ear about a better way. \cGenesis{} was a very minor \cGenesis{\God} of luck, one almost no one had heard of, one who had been cast aside just like you - but \cGenesis{} had big plans. And \cGenesis{\they} needed your help to make them a reality. One harrowing blood ritual later, and \cGenesis{} was able to free you from the smothering influence of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}, and make you \cGenesis{\their} first acolyte.

Under the protection of \cGenesis{} alone, you began to move through the poor, lonely, and forgotten of \pEarth{}. You brought what little comforts you could, material and spiritual, using your own personal brand of subtle, persuasive magic to smooth the way of the downtrodden. (In the subtlety, you are not so different from many \pShippies{}.) Of those you helped, some chose to follow you. Little by little, the group that you would come to call themselves the \pGoaties{} grew. \cChupSecond{} wasn’t your first follower, but \cChupSecond{\they} \cChupSecond{\were} the most capable of those first devotees you found and quickly rose to your right hand. \cChupSecond{} complemented your divine vision and charisma magic with \cChupSecond{\their} ability to turn it into reality. Between the two of you, the \pGoaties{} grew by leaps and bounds -- eventually enough to finally move on the world stage.

In preparation for your next big move, you leveraged the luck of \cGenesis{} and a few touches of charisma magic to land a very prestigious position for someone of your background - secretary to \cHeadDiplomat{}, one of the \pShip{}’s head diplomats. \cHeadDiplomat{\they} \cHeadDiplomat{\were} working in fleets 8, 9 and 10, to try to reduce the pirate threat. From such a position, you have had a much greater ability to move about in the world, collect information, and position your people where they can have the greatest effect. 

As your plans grew bolder, one of your most versatile tools have been Avengers - group members who act as assassins, but without the usual drawbacks. Through the power of \cGenesis{}, rather than the Avenger losing their memory, they are forgotten by others in their lives instead. This powerful tool has made assassinations an integral part of your strategy. It was the judicious use of one such avenger that got you to the \pSc{} today. The plan was simple -- send an low-level avenger after your Diplomat boss, \cHeadDiplomat{} on the eve of \cHeadDiplomat{\their} journey to the school. It was a win-win. Either \cHeadDiplomat{} would be killed, or \cHeadDiplomat{\they} would be forced to kill in self defence. Either way, \cHeadDiplomat{\they} would be unfit to attend the proceedings this weekend, leaving you as the foremost authority on \cHeadDiplomat{}’s plans for the negotiation. The cherry on the cake is that \cEbbPriest{}, the senior \cEbbPriest{\cleric} heading up the investigation, thought up the brilliant idea all on \cEbbPriest{\their} own that you should come along, allowing you to act suitably surprised at the news. It is good to have luck on your side.

Now that your plans are in place, it is finally time for the coup de grâce. It is time to rewrite the rules of the world to be more fair, equitable, and magic free. Everything hinges on the Storm. Most people, including most \pGoaties{}, believe that the only valid targets for the storm are the three nations. But you and a tight circle of other \pGoaties{} have consecrated a new relic - one that targets the storm to the \pSchool{}. To the eyes of all acolytes present except for yourself and \cChupSecond{}, the storm destroying the \pSc{} would not only serve as a powerful symbol that a new Deity has entered the pantheon, but also an assassination on many powerful people of all three nations, without the cost of memory loss. In reality, the plan goes one step further. The \pSc{} is the epicenter of the leylines through which all magic flows. If the storm were to strike the \pSc{}, it would annihilate the leylines along with it, thus cutting off all magic from the world. With magic gone, the followers of the other Gods will quickly turn to despair, and many will forsake the Gods who have forsaken them. But the \pGoaties{}, having been preparing for this, and will ride out the turmoil relatively unscathed. And when the dust settles, there will be five patron Deities, not four.

To make this work, first off you and your followers mustn't get caught. Secondly, you need to either install the relic you have constructed, or corrupt one of the other relics, causing it to be attuned to the \pSc{} instead of it’s home nation. In this you have the help of \cChupInventor{}, another of your friends and one of the oldest members of the group. You’ll have to watch out for the priests of each nation though, as they will be able to tell if the relics have been tampered with - perhaps necessitating taking a few of them out of the picture.

Once one or more relics are installed that are attuned to the school, you will need to get \emph{votes} for the school. Technically only the students are able to vote, but you have a devotee of \cGenesis{} among the students, \cChupStudent{}, which is a good start. You also know that others in the organization are targeting more students to try to bring them into the fold. And students get their voting power from the teachers and the advisors. You can lie, bribe, ensorcel, and blackmail any number of them to influence which students get more votes than others. And lastly, as \cGenesis{} is a \cGenesis{\God} of chance, you have a limited ability to influence the votes \textbf{after} they are cast, adding, changing, or removing some to tip the scales.

Since what you are trying to do would be\ldots controversial at best, it is being kept under tight wraps. You’ve also kept an ear out for other controversies and scandals you might be able to reveal as a distraction if needed. One such scandal was brought to you by \cChupInventor{}, and involves \cChupInventor{}’s friend, \cHeadScientist{}. \cHeadScientist{} has the weight of an entire nation on \cHeadScientist{\their} shoulders. \cHeadScientist{\They} \cHeadScientist{\have} been tasked with revealing a method to eliminate the storms forever, without destroying magic in \pEarth{}. You, of course, know this is impossible - you heard it from \cGenesis{}’s own lips. At the moment, you are much more interested in keeping the secret as a favor to your friend. But if you had to, you could reveal this to divert attention from your activities. After all, you’ve worked too hard to get here to allow moral compunctions stay your hand. For the sake of the world, you must NOT let the \pGoaties{} be stopped. Of course, if \cHeadScientist{} were to join you, that would be a different story. Protecting a comrade, after all, is a much more noble goal. Perhaps your assistance with the coverup will help on that score\ldots

Meanwhile, you’ve heard some unpleasant rumors that hit close to home. According to the rumors, \cChupSecond{}, your oldest ally and most trusted lieutenant, might be angling for the top spot in the \pGoaties{}. While \cChupSecond{} might have helped the process along, it was YOU that built the \pGoaties{} up from nothing, and YOU that is \cGenesis{}’s chosen one. You’re sure that if these rumors are true, this betrayal must be out of concern for the speed at which you are trying to make your move. \cChupSecond{} has always been the cautious one, after all. But now is no time to hesitate -- not when what you’ve worked for so hard is finally within your grasp. Even if this is true, though, you can’t accuse your second in command without proof -- especially because if the rumors are false, you will be burning a critical bridge. You’ve sent \cChupStudent{} to find out if \cChupSecond{} can be trusted. You hope that if push comes to shove, \cChupStudent{} will be loyal to you, and not fall for \cChupSecond{}’s overcautious rhetoric.

This news is extra concerning because of an important duty you had entrusted to \cChupSecond{} before hearing about it. That duty was the summoning of the Avatar of \cGenesis{} -- something that you know from speaking with \cGenesis{} will come with a lot of favor for whoever completes the ritual. If \cChupSecond{} really intends to betray you, you need to find a way to prevent \cChupSecond{\them} from leading that ritual -- just in case that favor is what \cChupSecond{\they} need\cChupSecond{\plural} to oust you.

Speaking of \pGoaties{} business, you have a particularly worrying issue to resolve right now with one of the personnel you stationed at the \pSc{}. You were supposed to have placed an avenger here sometime in the past, as a backup plan in case things went wrong. But you don’t remember who they are! This is a very bad sign, as it means that your Avenger may have gone rogue and killed someone they were not authorized to kill. You need to figure out who they are, and how to regain control of them if necessary.

On a less gloomy note, you got some unexpectedly good news from \cEbbPriest{}. Apparently the \cEbb{} Avatar has been killed - probably by someone looking to gain the upper hand in the war. Of course you pretended to be devastated when \cEbbPriest{\they} told you, but it really is a \emph{convenient} thing. Anything that weakens the other Deities, like losing their Avatar on \pEarth{} and the accompanying loss of contact with the divine, is a boon to you and \cGenesis{}. You should do everything in your power to stop them from doing anything to fix that problem.

As a more personal note, you have a grudge to settle with an interloper in \cGenesis{}’s magical domain. As the chosen of \cGenesis{}, you sensed a powerful curse as soon as you saw a student named \cInitiate{} -- a powerful curse of emph{bad luck}. How dare they abuse the domain of your God like that in your very presence! Irrational though it may be, you are incensed enough to help \cInitiate{} break that curse in order to prove your superiority, and that of \cGenesis{}.

This weekend is the culmination of years of work. You will elevate \cGenesis{} to their rightful place in the pantheon - equal to the other Deities, if not their better. You will accomplish this no matter what, by tasks both great and small, and the greatest being the destruction of the \pSchool{}, and with it, the loss of magic in all of \pEarth{}.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item End all magic in \pEarth{} to elevate \cGenesis{} to a patron \cGenesis{\God}. Modify the relics and manipulate the votes to direct the storm to the \pSc{}.
	\item Help \cChupInventor{} cover for \cHeadScientist{} as long as it is beneficial to the \pGoaties{} to do so.
	\item Determine if \cChupSecond{} is indeed trying to oust you, and if so, deal with \cChupSecond{\them} appropriately -- including preventing them from being the leader of the ritual to summon the Avatar.
	\item Prevent \cEbbPriest{} or anyone else from resurrecting the \cEbb{} avatar or finding another sustainable way to contact their Goddesses.
	\item Figure out who the Avenger is, and why you don’t remember them.
\item Help \cInitiate{} dispel \cInitiate{\their} bad luck curse.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You’ve told the other members of the \pGoaties{} that the result of destroying the school will be only to cement \cGenesis{}’s place in the pantheon. Only you and \cChupSecond{} know that it will also end all human’s ability to use magic. You know that many people would be opposed to this true purpose, including \cChupInventor{}
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cChupSecond{}} Your second in command and a teacher at the \pSc{}. \cChupSecond{\They} run\cChupSecond{\plural} the black market, and may not be as loyal to you as you would hope.
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} A teacher at the \pSc{}, your confidant, and one of your oldest followers who helps run the black market.
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} A student at the \pSc{} who is fanatically loyal to you as well as your cause.
	\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} The \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{} who is now in charge of the \pShip{} delegation.
	\contact{\cJuniorStatesman{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}’s apprentice. You have a good working relationship, and \cJuniorStatesman{} has no idea who you really are.
	\contact{\cInitiate{}} Suffers from a bad luck curse; you’ve been tasked with helping \cInitiate{\them} dispel the curse through the powers of \cGenesis{}
\contact{\cPirateChild{}} A seemingly innocent student at the \pSc{}\ldots who you’re almost certain you met as a crewmember on a pirate ship while traveling around with \cHeadDiplomat{}, even if \cPirateChild{\they} are going by a different name now. May be a useful tidbit for blackmail. 
\end{contacts}
