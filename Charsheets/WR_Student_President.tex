\name{\cPresident{}}

You are \cPresident{} (\cPresident{\they}/\cPresident{\them}), and a student at \pSchool{}. Now 22 years old, you were elected the Student Body President this year, and as such, it is your (self appointed) job to keep your fellow students safe when the adults won't. As an enrollee from \pShip{}, you follow the ways of \cEbb{\full} and \cFlow{\full} - but \cEbb{}’s teachings have always spoken to you most deeply. \cEbb{}’s focus on selective pruning of things that are no longer needed, in order to provide answers, closure, and a place for the new, is wonderful to you.

You were born in the 2nd fleet, and grew up with \cInitiate{}, your best friend. The two of you did everything together, right up until it was time to go to school. \cInitiate{\they} went to 1st fleet academy in order to study religion. Meanwhile, you went to the 2nd fleet academy, which focused on politics, negotiation, and economic management, as you hoped to follow in your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}'s footsteps and become a politician. The war breaking out in your 5th year of your schooling increased your fervor for your schoolwork. The only way out of this war was clearly going to be with diplomatic solutions that emphasized justice and reparations for past wrongs. At \pSchool{}, this education served you well. It has led you to become the student body president, a role that will really kickstart your political career. 

Since you were reunited with your best friend \cInitiate{}, the two of are more or less unstoppable\ldots Or would be if \cInitiate{\their} luck would stop being utterly rotten for 10 seconds. Three months ago, \cInitiate{} received a letter from ``long lost family'' in the \pFarm{}. They demanded \cInitiate{\their} immediate return to \pFarm{}, to take \cInitiate{\their} rightful place in the family. \cInitiate{} had no such inclination to do so initially, but the bad luck curse that came with the letter is really starting to wear \cInitiate{\them} down. The two of you have been working on a solution, and this weekend is your best chance to complete it. \cInitiate{}’s other friend, \cWarlordDaughter{}, has been somewhat of a distraction to this effort. For reasons you can’t fathom,  \cWarlordDaughter{} wants \cInitiate{} to give \cInitiate{\their} awful ``family'' a chance. Normally \cWarlordDaughter{} is a decent enough sort - so you’d like to convince \cWarlordDaughter{} of \cWarlordDaughter{\their} folly without destroying that relationship.

Since becoming student body president, you’ve been thinking more and more about how to protect the students. This mindset has brought with it the intense desire to figure out just what happened at the \pSc{} six years ago - just before the war started - when a unanimous vote sent the storm to \pShip{} just before the mass murder of every student who voted. How could the students from \pShip{} have ever voted to send the storm there out of turn? They would have known that it disrupted the balance, and that it would kill their families and friends. You know there was treachery, there simply must have been. While the Gods see to the punishment of the direct murderers, it is up to the God’s people to see that justice is brought upon those who enabled it. It is up to you and a few others you have convinced of the urgency of finding these answers - \cLibAssist{}, and \cHeir{}. You haven't been able to uncover the truth before now because your investigation hit a roadblock without a specific magical artifact - \iMirror{}, which is arriving this weekend in the possession of \cDiplomat{}. Now you just have to hope \cDiplomat{\they} will be willing to let you use it, and of course, be willing to keep your investigation quiet. This investigation is of the utmost importance. After all, what if whoever did this is still at the \pSc{}? And what if they try to do the same again\dots?

Uncovering the past isn't the only thing on your mind. You've also got to look to the future. For the good of your country, the student body in general, and for your friends among them, there are a couple of things happening this weekend that you can't just leave the grown ups in charge of. For the preservation of the school, it is important that the ley lines be renewed every three years. As student body president, you may be called upon to assist. A second thing is that this is your last year at the \pSc{}, and as such, you will be expected to participate in the graduation ceremony. And lastly, the most hands on task: The ritual to control the storm. After the voting, a ritual is enacted to channel the magic from the students into actually directing the storm. The ritual requires the use of one relic per nation. Per protocol, for the \pShip{}, the \iNet{} must be used. The \iChalice{} was used 3 years ago, and therefore, it is necessary for balance that they alternate. Further, the \iNet{} was involved in the ritual 6 years ago. It is fitting that it be used in the ritual the year you are going to set right which once went wrong. You anticipate that setting up the ritual will be the most challenging of these tasks as you have been warned to expect politicking over which relics to use.

Something that may put the ritual in jeopardy is a problem related to one of the most important figures in the ritual - the fact that the Librarian, \cLibrarian{}, has been acting\ldots odd. Almost as if \cLibrarian{\they} can't remember how to do \cLibrarian{\their} job. Like \cLibrarian{\they} can't emph{remember} how to do their job. Normally publicly accusing someone of murder induced amnesia is a faux-pas - people generally consider amnesia to be sufficient punishment - but sometimes it is necessary, especially if you can't figure out who they killed and why. \cLibrarian{} is supposed to be the most knowledgeable person at the school about the ritual, but if \cLibrarian{\they} really \cLibrarian{\have} lost \cLibrarian{\their} memories, particularly for foul reasons, you may be called upon as a substitute.

In and among all of the responsibilities as Student Body President, time has rather gotten away from you on the social front. You kept meaning to approach \cHeir{} or \cChupStudent{} romantically, but have never quite gotten around to it. And now might be your last chance! Rushing the job might make things a bit awkward, but \cInitiate{} makes a great wing\cInitiate{\person}. Despite not having any current partners, you identify as polyamorous. Could you possibly be lucky enough that both \cHeir{} and \cChupStudent{} might be interested in you, and willing to try? And could you really go the rest of your life not knowing what might have been?

The last thing on your mind comes in the form of a nagging worry about your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}, \cHeadDiplomat{}. You were really looking forward to seeing your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle} after a long absence, and getting \cHeadDiplomat{\their} advice on your troubles - the two of you were quite close before you went away to academy, and \cHeadDiplomat{\they} never steered you wrong. But just yesterday, you received news from \cEbbPriest{} that \cHeadDiplomat{} won't be coming for unspecified reasons. It’s very unlike your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle} to cancel plans like this. You need to know what happened to \cHeadDiplomat{\them} - and you fear the worst.

Your last weekend at \pSchool{} will be packed. You and your country both have a lot riding on your actions here. Your top priorities are to ensure that the ritual goes smoothly, figure out what happened to \cHeadDiplomat{\Auncle} \cHeadDiplomat{}, and to maybe find love along the way. It will be a lot - but with \cInitiate{} by your side, you believe you are up for the challenge.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item  Ensure the ritual to control the Storm is set up correctly. Don't let anyone interfere with it, and ensure that \iNet{} is used in the ritual.
	\item Find out what happened to the students six years ago with the help of \cHeir{} and \cLibAssist{}. Bring anyone responsible who hasn't been punished by the Gods to human justice and make sure they can't do anything like that to you and your classmates.
	\item Find out what happened to your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}, \cHeadDiplomat{}. Maybe \cEbbPriest{} knows something?
	\item Figure out if there's any chance of getting together with \cHeir{} and/or \cChupStudent{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are graduating this year.

	\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} \cInitiate{}’s other friend. A decent enough sort, but definitely has some strange inclinations regarding \cInitiate{}’s curse.
\contact{\cLibrarian{}} A kind person on the surface, but acting extremely suspiciously. You suspect amnesia, which might mean foul play.
	\contact{\cHeir{}} You have a crush on \cHeir{\them}. Is it possible to start a relationship? Is \cHeir{} even interested?
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} You have a crush on \cChupStudent{\them}. Is it possible to start a relationship? Is \cChupStudent{} even interested?
