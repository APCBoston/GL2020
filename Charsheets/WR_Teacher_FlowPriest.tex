\name{\cFlowPriest{}}

You are \cFlowPriest{\full} (\cFlowPriest{\they}/\cFlowPriest{\them}), and a teacher at \pSchool{}. You teach Mathematics, and have done so for the last 15 years. Mathematics is the language of nature, and understanding that language allows you to understand and create \emph{beautiful} things, and use that understanding to make balanced decisions. It is through your love of patterns, the predictions they allow, and the creation of new things that you serve \cFlow{\full}.

You grew up in \pShip{}, the \cFlowPriest{\child} of architects in the 4th fleet. You built your first model boat when you were five. In your teenage years, you moved around among a number of ships, ultimately settling in a woodworking compound in 6th fleet Shell Bay. From there you went to 2nd fleet Academy to study Religion. You were drawn particularly to \cFlow{}, and soon completed your initiation to \cFlow{\their} Path. 

You ended up serving in 5th fleet, Coral Sands Harbor town. While the work was nice, you aspired to more. Eventually a position came open at \pSchool{}, to which you applied and were selected. Ever since then, you have worked at the \pSc{}, shaping the new minds that come through, and sending them out into the world to do \cFlow{}’s work.

In the past few years, you have struck up correspondences with several like minded individuals around \pEarth{}. One of your favorites is \cCurse{}. Over time the two of you have gone from just chatting about magical theory to actually creating something completely new. Humans have never in recorded history set foot in the Realm of the Gods. But where there is a will, there is a way. You and \cCurse{} have begun work on \iMagicBeans{} which, once you complete them this weekend, can be planted and will grow into a portal that will connect \pEarth{} to the Realm of the Gods - you think. You won’t know for sure until you try it! To those who would naysay such endeavors, you ask why they should fear the Gods so. Just because no one has done something yet does not mean it shouldn’t be done. Just because a worthy endeavor requires a few taboo rituals doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. By the teachings of \cFlow{}, it is quite the opposite - the new and innovative is particularly beloved of your Goddess, and what is legal is not always what is beneficial for humanity.

If only things on \pEarth{} were in better shape. \pFarm{} and \pTech{} were fools to upset the fragile balance, and the war that \cLoud{\full} brings to bear on them is their just reward. But you fear that someone has meddled further. The \cEbb{} Avatar on \pEarth{} is dead. You know from the lips of the Goddesses to your own ears. Avatars don’t die of natural causes. Someone killed it. Someone very strong in magic, who had some way to lure the Avatar to shore, or found a ship treacherous enough to carry them to deep waters. You have little doubt that pirates were involved.

Still, all hope is not lost. It can’t be just fortune that \cEbbPriest{}, \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{}, is coming to the \pSchool{} as part of the \pShip{} Advisor contingent. Surely, this is a sign that the two of you are destined to work a ritual to resurrect the Avatar! With this in mind, you have enlisted \cEbbPriest{}’s aid, as well as that of \cInitiate{}, an as of yet undecided initiate, to assist you. Of course, there are complications of which the answers have yet to reveal themselves. Chief among them is the central problem of where you are supposed to get a live sea serpent to act as a host. Not far behind, though, is the matter of keeping things quiet. If word should get out as to what you are trying to do, the other nations would surely try to stop you, as being short an Avatar puts the \pShippies{} at a grave disadvantage in the war. 

The two of you will have a lot of responsibilities as the best source of comfort and support for the people of your nation. That’s why you are glad to know that you may get some backup at the \pSc{} this weekend if all goes well. It is your job to guide the two initiates here, \cInitiate{} and \cWarlordDaughter{}, as they decide which path to pick and, if they prove worthy, to induct them as full fledged clergy members. And if anyone should express a sincere desire to join the \pShip{} religion, and forsake their own, helping them do that falls to you as well. You must impress upon anyone you induct, be it as clergy or worshipper, to always bear in mind that no matter who they are or what anyone says, your responsibility lies first and foremost with your deities. This is not a burden you take lightly.

Perhaps the most important thing going on this weekend will be the Ritual to control the Storm. As a teacher, it’s important for you to ensure that the ritual goes off without a hitch, that the relics are being treated respectfully, and that the students are taking a proper interest in the proceedings. If the ritual were to fail to complete, the uncontrolled disaster of the Storm would rain down on all of \pEarth{}, and especially upon \pSc{}. This is obviously something to be avoided. As a \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlow{} specifically, you have opinions on how the ritual should be completed. Specifically, you want to make sure that the \iNet{} is the artifact that represents \pShip{} instead of the \iChalice{}, as you have heard whispers that someone wanted to use the \iChalice{} instead. While the \iChalice{} would technically serve, since time immemorial the two artifacts have been rotated every time the ritual was performed in order to preserve the ever important balance so core to the worship of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}. You are not sure of the consequences if \iChalice{} were to be used instead, but you are not keen to find out.

With all of that going on, you really hope that you won’t be too busy for the Graduation Ceremony. It is traditional that a teacher hailing from each of the different nations gives a speech once every three years. Well, this year, the \pShip{} are up, and you are of the opinion that you are the best choice. You know that \cPirate{} has expressed an interest in it too, but really, who could be better to send students off to create a better world than a \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlow{\full}? Their mindset when leaving the \pSc{} is critical, so you need to make sure that you do everything you can to influence that in a positive direction.

This weekend will be extremely busy. You need to make sure that the ritual goes off without a hitch, resurrect the avatar of your people, and pave the way to meet your deities, all while performing your normal duties as \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlow{} and Mathematics professor. You may have a lot to accomplish - but as always, your faith in the balance that defines your people will see you through. 

%\textbf{Primary Plots:}

%The Net of Two Phases - Use the net in the ritual. Needed for balance. Relics are dual nature (path of balance), but alternating them is still important. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rv5safAChTNCpSK-80O9Q7a3R7tQ5Mwfe89AwtFA0bs/edit?usp=sharing

%Preparing the Ritual - Want this to go well; keep an eye on it, check that the relics are being treated correctly and that students are taking an interest in something so important. Understanding tradition is key to innovating https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xCN7BLfzBB3Tt237YSzGKusQj7cmi6nQxATP6aCLgEQ/edit?usp=sharing

%Resurrect the L'eau Avatar - Your private spiritual practices involve getting messages directly from the goddesses. While you are a priestess of Flow, you did not infrequently get messages from Ebb as well, until <TIME AGO>. You didn’t even need Flow to tell you that Ebb’s avatar had been killed - you knew. How could this have been done? It would have required a very strong magic user, and some way to call the avatar, or a ship willing to carry the killer. You intend to find out who did it, see that justice is served, and also resurrect the Avatar. All you need now is a baby sea serpent… where are you supposed to get one of those? https://docs.google.com/document/d/13JWwHSUpGKjez2YLFkQf0XKcP2fyYYhZricUc0hGeoY/edit?usp=sharing

%Magical Beans- Make a portal to the world of the gods. Working with \cCurse{} via mail to develop magic plants that when planted will grow rapidly and create a portal. You’d love to see the home of Ebb and Flow, and besides, creation of things totally new is one of the most sacred ways to honor \cFlow{} https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r4NaDOpXymHkepAylg2TNgP_q6NeVitGcoGB1pCfPYY/edit?usp=sharing
%(Amy + Ghost making magical cabbages to open a portal to the realm of the Gods)

%\textbf{Secondary Plots:}

%Rescuing Joe  - as a priestess, you have access to a wide range of rituals, for many things, including welcoming someone new into Ebb and Flow’s grace if someone wishes to join the \pShip{} religion https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pn1RCDSTLRcF6wh123S6pxhYpeM1iCkjbLGpIWk2d5s/edit?usp=sharing

%The Science is a Lie! - New rituals, and new uses for magic are good and should be celebrated. Whether something is currently “legal” is but a small matter; legality can be changed once the value of the action has been established. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7L-Xw5JUmcaRrfGWNMFzNIGMqQR4WkVZst5dXFkt1E/edit?usp=sharing

%Graduation Ceremony / Demonstration - Wants to give the speech. It is the \pShip{} turn, and it’s such a great opportunity to send the graduating students off with the right mind set. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iAz5uNQaKwcLueLuVdehK_7QhkevpFcTAKjJ4P1lujg/edit?usp=sharing

%Pick a path  - help \cInitiate{}, \cWarlordDaughter{}, and any one else who shows interest to pick a path and complete their initiation. Just make sure they are serious; this is a great responsibility https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ifentj32eb9RBGo1B8UOOa917YfhfdkWgBXpHOtgi6A/edit?usp=sharing

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Ensure the Ritual to control the Storm is properly set up. Encourage as many students as possible to take an active hand in the set up, and educate them on the functions of all the steps so they can understand the system.
	\item Have the \iNet{} be used in the ritual - it is necessary for balance.
	\item Resurrect the \cEbb{} Avatar and keep it secret from the other nations.
	\item Finish the \iMagicBeans{}, plant them, and if possible, visit the Realm of the Gods.
\item Convince \cMusic{} to pick you to give the speech in the Graduation ceremony and then give a moving and inspiring speech.
\item Help guide \cInitiate{} and \cWarlordDaughter{} in their path to becoming Clergy
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You and \cCurse{} currently have \iBeansNB{}. You will need to complete several steps together before you can convert them to the \iMagicBeans{} you need to reach the realm of the Gods.
	\item Until the \cEbb{} Avatar is resurrected, both the path of \cEbb{} and the Path of Balance are locked to new initiates.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cCurse{}} A kindred spirit in \pFarm{}, \cCurse{} has been working with you on the \iMagicBeans{} to reach the realm of the Gods.
\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} A surprising addition to the Advisor delegation from \pShip{}, but you will be grateful to have \cEbbPriest{\their} support this weekend.
	\contact{\cInitiate{}} A trustworthy initiate of the \pShippies{} religion. As \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are} graduating this year, it is about time \cInitiate{} picks a path and comes into \cInitiate{\their} full power.
\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} An initiate of the \pShippies{} religion. \cWarlordDaughter{} is in \cWarlordDaughter{\their} second year at the \pSc{}, and still has some time to choose a path.
\contact{\cPirate{}} Your friendly rival for the honor of giving the teacher’s speech. Often sees things from too narrow a perspective.
\end{contacts}
