%%Marie AKA Marie Chelberg AKA FPF Advisor HeadScientist

You are \cHeadScientist{\full} (\cHeadScientist{\they}/\cHeadScientist{\them}), and 57 years old.  You are the premier scientist of \pTech{}, a position you’ve held for almost eight years. You like to think of yourself as a combination of fun loving approachability and dedication to your work. This weekend you are attending the \pSchool{} as an Advisor, an event you’d been looking forward to until recent developments dashed any hope of positivity. Now you’re in for a rough weekend, but at least you’ll get to spend some time with your life long friend, \cChupInventor{}, so it’s not a total loss.

As the head of the \pTech{} scientist’s guild, you are leading the national effort to invent a way to permanently eliminate the magical Storms that have long ravaged the three nations of \pEarth{}.  You’ve been at the forefront of this mission since you took over the decade-long project six years ago. Up until about three months ago, you and your team had been following several promising hypotheses as to the connection between magic as humans wield it, and the Storms themselves. You had hoped to uncover a common source. From there, you could devise a way to block the magic from funneling into the storm, while preserving the conduit to humanity. Unfortunately, two weeks ago the last of a series of experiments confirmed the opposite. The layman's explanation is that the Storms are an inevitable part of magic, the same way that rain is an inevitable part of the water cycle. The Storms exist as long as magic exists. There is no way to end the Storms short of the permanent eradication of all Magic. Which is both impossible (it would be like stopping the rain from falling) and an untenable outcome. Not one iota of technology would work without magic. The \pTech{} would be reduced to rubbing sticks together and praying for fire. Would the Gods even listen if humanity rejected their greatest gift? You can’t even begin to fathom the impact this knowledge would have on the war between the three nations, or on the all important treaty which has sheltered \pTech{} from the storm for the past six years.  

And what abominable timing!  You are tasked with presenting at the \pSchool{}, and when you reported the failure of the mission to your liaison at the Council you were ordered under no uncertain terms to lie, claim that it works, and that you have a solution. What a mess this is!  It’s up to you to do the impossible and try to contain this issue while the Council determines the appropriate course for dealing with this news. You are already preparing for the inevitable damage control that’s about to be your problem. On that front, you certainly hope to have at least some allies. Your assistant scientist, \cAssistantScientist{}, has almost as much to lose here as you do, so perhaps the two of you can put your heads together over this. Still, it’s a risk. It’s not impossible that \cAssistantScientist{\they} might try to shift blame entirely to your shoulders, saving \cAssistantScientist{\their} own career at the expense of yours, when in fact \cAssistantScientist{} has been one of the most prolific contributors despite not always doing quality work. The truth might have come to light sooner without \cAssistantScientist{\their} bumbling and you would have had more time to prepare.

You’ll have a far more solid ally in \cChupInventor{}. You last saw \cChupInventor{\them} six years ago, the last time you were at \pSc{}, although you keep in frequent contact through letter writing. The two of you grew up together and could always rely on one another. It was your own research that supported \cChupInventor{\their} greatest invention: refrigeration coils. You were the one that convinced \cChupInventor{} to take the invention to the Temple. You were disappointed when they rejected it, but \cChupInventor{} was absolutely crushed. You have done your best over the years to try to support \cChupInventor{}, but \cChupInventor{\they} have nursed a mean grudge against \cChupInventor{\plural} to this day. You need to do what you can to snap \cChupInventor{\them} out of it.

Six years ago, you were supporting \cChupInventor{} in a different way. You were the junior scientist then, brought along to the weekend at the \pSchool{} as a PR move. You were just supposed to stand around and look clever. But then an advisor named \cEvil{} approached you and made you an offer you really couldn’t refuse. You were given replicas of the magical stones used for voting, and tasked with swapping them out for the real ones. The real stones were an immense source of magical energy, completely unregulated by the Church of \cTechGod{}. You were hesitant, but you recognized an opportunity when you saw one and gave them to \cChupInventor{} to empower some of \cChupInventor{\their} inventions even after being banned from the Temple. In exchange for swapping out the stones without getting caught, you were elevated to an incredibly high station in the scientist guild (one that someone of your background could never have achieved otherwise) and put in charge of stopping the Storms. You were \emph{supposed} to be the greatest scientist in all of history\ldots but now you wonder if whoever put \cEvil{} up to talking to you hasn’t been laughing at you the whole time after the disastrous betrayal that occurred with your help. Regardless, you have to steer anyone investigating what happened 6 years ago down some dead end or distract them. There is no denying your fingerprints are all over that mess.

So you started looking for a way out. Contingency plans are always good. Still, you wouldn’t have expected the church to be your solution. When \cBeetle{} wrote to you a few months back inviting you to study with \cBeetle{\them}, you brushed the invitation off. But now that you think of it, if you were a \cHeadScientist{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}, you’d be somewhat protected from the legal system of the \pTech{}. Of course, \cBeetle{}’s position is only available if \cBeetle{\they} are selected as the next principal of the \pSc{}. And 57 is a little late to enter the game -- you’ll have to work very, very hard to convince \cAntiChup{} and \cBeetle{} that you actually want to become a \cHeadScientist{\cleric}, and are suited to the role.

Part of that convincing is working with the student named \cScholarship{}, and by extension \cEbbPriest{}. \cEbbPriest{} is a scholar researching \pEarth{}’s creation story. \cBeetle{} has approved this as a project for you to work on to demonstrate your aptitude for this type of work, and has asked you to guide \cScholarship{} along as well to demonstrate your ability to mentor youngsters and encourage them to properly follow the teachings of \cTechGod{}.

You haven’t been back to the \pSc{} in six years. It feels a little surreal to be back, after you were whisked home and into your successful new life in the shadow of the deaths of 12 children. You were restless, so you wandered off through the gardens. As you wandered, you fiddled with some of your technology. You always carry many small projects with you. Most of them are novelties -- little more than fidget toys. But sometimes there really is no replacement for a self-mixing bowl and you are suddenly the most popular person in the room. On your way back to the rest of the \pTech{} contingent of advisors, you (literally) ran into a stranger. \cChupAvenger{\They} gave you a warm smile and waved off your apologies. As you continued on your way, you wondered why \cChupAvenger{\they} felt familiar. You’ve never seen this person in your life.

So this weekend is probably going to be a disaster. You’ve got to keep a lid on the truth about the Storms for as long as possible. You’ve got to keep an eye on \cChupInventor{} and support your friend. And you’ve got to make sure your plan to hide behind the protection of the Priesthood is airtight. You aren’t one to pray for luck, but you can certainly pray that \cTechGod{} grants you the skill and wisdom to see it all through.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Present the \pTech{} solution to the Storms on Saturday afternoon. Since there is no actual solution, this is likely to turn into ``manage the fallout’’ very quickly.
	\item Solidify an escape plan, either through \cBeetle{} or another way, in case it becomes necessary.
	\item Work with \cScholarship{} and \cEbbPriest{} on questions surrounding the creation of magic, humanity, and \pEarth{} itself.
	\item Keep anyone from investigating what happened to the students 6 years ago too closely.
	\item Use your various technological trinkets to help people out.
\end{itemz}

%%Needs mempacket to open based on \cChupAvenger{}’s badge number “this is the stranger you ran into. Why do they feel familiar? You’ve never met them in your life.”

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cAssistantScientist{}} Your primary assistant. \cAssistantScientist{} is both your greatest ally and greatest liability in keeping the fact that you can’t get rid of the storms under wraps. If the two of you work together, you will both probably get out of this with your skins intact, if not your reputations. If you throw \cAssistantScientist{} under the bus, you might get out completely safe. But if \cAssistantScientist{\they} do it to you\ldots
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} Your closest friend for most of your life. \cChupInventor{} is a brilliant inventor, but \cChupInventor{\their} greatest invention was stymied by the Church. You aren’t sure if you should continue to enable \cChupInventor{\their} grudge.
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} The \cBeetle{\cleric} who has offered to train you as a \cHeadScientist{\cleric}. It’s not a terrible escape plan if things go sideways with the science.
	\contact{\cScholarship{}} The student you are supposed to be mentoring while researching the creation myth.
	\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} The head scholar on the creation myth project. You haven’t met in person before, but \cEbbPriest{\they} seem competent, albeit a little stern, and a bit of a stickler for rules.
	\contact{\cEvil{}} The person who gave you the fake voting stones. Since realizing the storms cannot be stopped without the complete destruction of magic, (which is impossible anyway), you sometimes wonder idly if it wasn’t all some big trick played on you.

Scientists/CHUP target x1 Marie?? EV: A research scientist selected by Council Scientist to LEAD research (is on the hook for it), and employed by the council who studies subjects deemed relevant.  Current primary project is the means to stop the Storm while maintaining the use of magic.  Will make a presentation at the school, and is involved in convincing the AGRARIANS.	"grew up with Chris, research supported his invention, she encouraged him to take it to the temple, they were both disappointed, still supportive after, feels a little guilt over what happened, would like to see him happier, help him.  works with Amanda
Former relationship with Joe; doesn't remember him."	looking for peeps to support lie, esp chris, needs allies, Marie swapped in fake voting stones at the ritual when the betrayal was done, and used the power they stole from the majority of students to enable Chris's tech illegally.

Marie obtained fake voting stones from Eric, swapped them in for empowered one, basically rigged the election in order to gain the empowered stones to give to Chris.  It all started when Diplomat said someone from COS \cEvil{} would help rig the vote so as to give Marie more time to make the science work.  Marie and Ev both want this to not be investigated
