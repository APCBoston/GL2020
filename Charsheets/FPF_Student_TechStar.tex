%%Daniel Kane AKA Kane AKA FPF Student TechStar

You are \cTechStar{} (\cTechStar{\they}/\cTechStar{\them}), 19 years old and technological prodigy.  You are a first year student at \pSchool{}, and come from the fair but rigid \pTech{}, ruled by \cTechGod{} who both inspires creativity and (in your own privately blasphemous opinion) severely limits the benefits of progress to all. The one thing you want more than anything else is to follow your dreams of spreading your technology to the world, and you won’t let anything, God or mortal, stop you.  An idealist to your core, you know you could use the tremendous opportunities of your new position as TechStar, and the spectacular invention that won you the title, to help those less able to help themselves.

Growing up as the beloved only \cTechStar{\child} of a loving and moderately well to do family in \pTech{}, you always knew you wanted to be an inventor.  You began in the traditional way, dissecting the family suction cleaner, to your parents’ delight.  They dutifully provided you with materials, tools, and the education you would need to succeed, and you have exceeded their wildest expectations by inventing VidCom (Video Communication) devices, which allow two people to communicate remotely.  This concept is mindblowing in a world of letter writing and slow post, and your invention easily won you the TechStar competition. You almost felt sorry for the other competitors, but you knew your invention can do the world the most good.  

Upon winning the competition you were granted the TechStar Council position in the government for a year, and admission to \pSchool{} as well due to your innate magical ability, as well as a number of prestigious job offers that will be open to you once your education is complete. It’s hard to keep up with the Council’s work alongside all your schoolwork, but you do your best, attending Council meetings when absolutely necessary, voting by proxy when possible, and abstaining when the matters at hand are not in your area of expertise. You’ve been lucky to have the help, and friendship, of \cScholarship{}, who’s always happy to chat or help you with your schoolwork.

Unfortunately, despite your lofty achievements and position, you feel enormously disappointed with the way \pTech{} has handled the development and distribution of your VidCom devices.  You’d assumed that they would immediately enter mass production and be given to people around the country, selling for a reasonable price, but this did not occur. The Council, above your objections, agreed with the Temple and Magician’s guild’s refusal to magically enable more than a handful of the devices. They said they were ``too important’’ to the war effort, and that handing them to the public would inevitably lead to them getting into the hands of the enemy.  It’s ridiculous!  You know there’s a war on, but surely people being able to communicate with their loved ones would boost morale and national pride?

And the war seems like a mistake in the first place. Why can’t the nations work things out peacefully? Why shouldn’t people of all nations come together through your Vidcom Devices, and see that they are not three separate nations, but one people, sharing the planet? You feel that all three governments have mishandled the war just like the council mishandled your invention. You are going to fix it - by yourself if that’s what it takes.

Your entrance to \pSchool{} has provided you many opportunities, and some of them are directly related to your goal of spreading your tech to the world. Most importantly, you’ve heard credible rumors about the existence of a black market that sells tech from \pTech{} at the \pSc{} - and a black market that sells tech MUST be able to activate it without reprisal from \cTechGod{}! You’ve been unable to subtly track it down until now, but you have a hunch that this weekend, as a meeting of all three nations, will be a chance that black market actors can’t pass up. If you can set up a stable supply chain of production for your vidcom devices for the black market, and ideally sell a few from the start to get some seed money, you’ll be one step closer to your dream. Under no circumstances will you sell the plans this weekend though. You may eventually, but not until you’ve gotten yourself established!

While that plan may get things rolling, you have higher aspirations. If you could get \cTechGod{}’s blessing to activate your technology yourself, you wouldn’t need the black market in the long run. \cTechGod{} has granted the power to oversee the activation of tech to the Temple, but they’re clearly not acting in a manner that honors \cTechGod{} or your people any more, because they are keeping your tech out of the hands of the people whose lives it could greatly improve. You have the magical power it would take to activate VidCom devices yourself, but the laws of \cTechGod{} decree that doing so would have unimaginable consequences. You recently overheard \cFlowPriest{} and \cCurse{} talking about some enchanted beans that could create a portal to the world of the Gods themselves, and this immediately set your mind spinning. Is that really possible? You’re not sure, but at the end of the day, it’s too tempting to pass up. You are going to help those two, and if this isn’t some kind of pipe dream, get them to take you with them to the realm of the Gods - then beseech \cTechGod{} to favor you and your people by changing this sacred law - or at least grant you an exemption. Surely, \cTechGod{} will see that the Temple is mistaken, and correct the situation.

When you’re not busy working out how to change the fundamentals of your religion and country, you’ve also got a couple of other important projects on your plate.  Your friend \cDisney{}’s birthday is coming up on Saturday, and you want to surprise \cDisney{\them}.  Since \cDisney{\them} \cDisney{\were} awakened recently from 200 years of magical sleep, \cDisney{\they} \cDisney{\have} some gaps in \cDisney{\their} memory that \cDisney{\they} mentioned to you, and you got the strong feeling that \cDisney{\they} wished \cDisney{\they} could remember clearly.  You’re sure with a little research and innovation you could convert an old invention concept into a device that would aid in recovering lost memories.  It’s a perfect gift, and you know \cDisney{\they}’ll be happy. You’ve already made arrangements with a stellar engineer named \cBunker{} to bring you materials -- you’re not entirely sure if he’ll have everything you’ll need to finish the present, but he’s bringing at least some supplies.

Speaking of \cDisney{}, \cDisney{\they} \cDisney{\have} become close with a shady character, \cWildCard{}. While \cWildCard{} might have been the one to wake \cDisney{} up and \cDisney{\they} are justifiably grateful for that, you’re pretty certain that \cWildCard{\their} motives were less than pure. \cWildCard{} is just\ldots shifty, and you’d really prefer that \cDisney{} just stay away entirely.

In other happenings going on this weekend, you’re also very, VERY interested in learning all you can about the inner technological and magical workings of the all important Bunkers at the school, and you’ll get just one chance to gain access. You’ve volunteered to help with the planned maintenance and repairs that will be happening soon, and you’re thrilled at the chance to work with \cBunker{}, who actually built the bunkers!

There are a few other things going on this weekend. Your favorite teacher \cBeetle{} is one of the finalists for the position of principal, in a heated competition with another teacher. You don’t know how much you can do, but you’d love to help \cBeetle{\them} out if you can. You heard that \cBeetle{}’s audition involves some kind of ritual?

The other thing you are interested in this weekend is the graduation ceremony. You won’t be graduating, of course, but you hear that these ceremonies traditionally involve a demonstration of power. As one of the more magically gifted and creative students, you believe that honor belongs to you, if you can swing it.

At the end of the day, while there are a lot of things going on that deserve your attention, if you can secure a route to activate and distribute your VidCom devices safely, you’ll leave happy - there’s simply too much at stake there to not. If you can make sure that \cDisney{} remains safe and happy, so much the better. This will be your weekend - you can feel it.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Secure a solid path to activate and distribute your VidCom devices to as many people as possible, and turn a profit while doing so.
	\item Determine whether the portal to the Realm of the Gods is feasible, and if it is, help make it a reality so you can speak to \cTechGod{}.
	\item Investigate and safeguard the Bunkers to the best of your ability
	\item Keep \cDisney{} safe from whatever \cWildCard{} is really planning
	\item Make a great birthday present for \cDisney{} with the supplies from \cBunker{}
	\item Help \cBeetle{} become Principal

	\contact{\cWildCard{}} A shady \cWildCard{\person} who woke \cDisney{} from \cDisney{\their} enchanted slumber. Has ulterior motives.
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} Your favorite teacher, even though Religion isn’t your favorite subject. 
	\contact{\cCurse{}} You don’t know much about \cCurse{\them}, beyond them being a bit weird, but \cCurse{\they} \cCurse{\have} the key to something you really 	want - access to \cTechGod{}.  
	\contact{\cFlowPriest{}} A decent enough teacher, but mostly interesting since \cFlowPriest{\they} \cFlowPriest{\have} the key to something you really want - access to \cTechGod{}.
