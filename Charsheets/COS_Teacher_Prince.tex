\name{\cPrince{}}

You are \cPrince{\full} (\cPrince{\they}/\cPrince{\them}), and 38 years old. You've been teaching curse breaking at the \pSchool{} for the past 5 years but have much bigger plans. You are the youngest \cPrince{\child} of \cQueen{\full}, ruler of the \pFarm{}. None of your siblings want the throne as badly as you, so you intend to take it---assuming of course you can remedy a\ldots{}complication.

From a very young age, it was obvious you were your \cQueen{\parent}'s \cPrince{\child}. The royal court of \pFarm{} is a pit of vipers---something your \cQueen{\parent} encourages. The constant fighting is good for the nobility. It keeps them from thinking of uniting against \cQueen{\them}, and elevates the most devious and ruthless to the top of \cQueen{\their} counsel. You took to the whole thing like a duck to water, while your siblings floundered terribly.  Still, you are the \emph{youngest} of quite a large family, and while your \cQueen{\parent} favors you, \cQueen{\they} cannot declare you the heir-apparent without good cause. While your \cQueen{\parent} worked on the details, you were sent off to teach at the \pSchool{} for a few years. This kept you safe from those clever enough to read the signs, and with a preference for one of your siblings.

At the school, you teach curse breaking. Curses aren't normally the purview of the nobility---noble magic (read: powerful magic, valuable magic, useful magic) should be used to imbue the land with fertility so that the crops will grow. After all, without an infusion of magic every spring to both the land and the seeds, the \pFarm{} couldn't feed even one third of its population, let alone make exports to the \pTech{} and the \pShip{} (err, before the war anyway). But neither you nor your \cQueen{\parent} are fools. \emph{Protection} from curses is prudent for nobility, and royalty in particular. And it's not so hard to prepare them either. You've prepared your share of bespoke curses for powerful families when the issue at hand was too delicate for them to go to a commoner for. In most cases, what you asked for in return was their support for your claim to the throne when your \cQueen{\parent} dies.

Most recently you created a bad luck curse that was a particularly clever bit of work---embedded nigh undetectably in a letter, it wouldn't trigger until opened by someone of the same flesh and blood as the one who commissioned the piece. It was somewhat to your surprise when that self-same curse showed up at the school---none other than \cInitiate{\full} bore your curse. \cInitiate{\They} must be the grand\cInitiate{\child} so sorely sought by the Fairweather family who commissioned the curse. So far you've kept your mouth shut, but you wonder if you ought not to talk to \cInitiate{} about it. Not that you can undo the curse. Curses of this kind are impossible to undo as far as you know, except by meeting the stipulations made when the curse was created---in this case, traveling to the Fairweather estate. While the family already owes you one favor for the curse, it rarely hurts to sweeten the pot. You could try to apply pressure of your own to get \cInitiate{} to return to \cInitiate{\their} family in Children of the Sun. At the very least, it is worth keeping an eye on the situation; if your curse fails to fulfill its intended purpose, you'll lose the support of the Fairweathers.

When the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s plan was finally ready, your \cQueen{\parent} called you home, and gave you a task. One month ago, \cQueen{\They} entrusted you with one of the two royal signet rings. The other stays on your \cQueen{\parent}'s finger at all times. It was your task to bring it to Duke \cChupStudent{\formal}, father to \cChupStudent{\full} and use it to approve some piece of legislation he had drafted. A simple enough task, and one that you were more than capable of---unless of course, the worst kind of bad luck were to strike. And strike it did. You were waylaid by pirates on your way to your destination, and while you escaped with your life, almost all of your possessions were stolen---including the ornately carved wooden box in which the ring was kept. Pirates\ldots{}You thought you hated them before, but now they might have cost you the throne. \emph{Unacceptable}. The pirates who attacked you had an inside person embedded among your guard. When approached by the seemingly innocent caravan, they must have exchanged some code word or phrase. You remember them talking of bravery, and charting courses. You don't remember the exact words, but if you hear a phrase like, ``Those brave enough to chart the course claim the prize,'' you can be reasonably sure it has something to do with piracy.

For now you've managed to forestall your \cQueen{\parent} finding out, but that won't last much longer. \cQueen{\They} has demanded the signed and stamped document as soon as possible---and you think you can only hold out until the end of the weekend at latest. You must recover the signet ring somehow, at all costs. You hope that the black market (of which you have heard only rumors) will have some leads. The information won't come cheaply however, and you are prepared to trade in information and curses as necessary to get what you need.

As long as you are keeping an eye out for the black market, you might as well do another chore and keep an eye on \cAdopted{\full}. \cAdopted{}'s family are staunch supporters of your \cQueen{\parent}, and they have some concerns that their adopted \cAdopted{\child} may be straying from \cAdopted{\their} noble duties. Doing what you can to put \cAdopted{\them} back on the straight and narrow could cement the \cAdopted{\formal}s' support for your bid for the throne. There is also \cMusic{\full}, \cMusic{\auncle} to \cAdopted{}'s adoptive father, to consider. \cMusic{} is a fellow teacher and has spent long enough at the school that \cMusic{\their} loyalties to their home country and family may have atrophied significantly. You aren't sure where \cMusic{\they} stand on this matter, or indeed on your bid for the throne. \cMusic{\They} could be a powerful ally or a difficult enemy. You should carefully feel them out.

Speaking of allies, \cAntiChup{\full} has struck up a correspondence with you, and proven a most unexpected ally. It seems that \cAntiChup{} has quite a bit of ambition of \cAntiChup{\their} own, and wants your help in aiding \cAntiChup{\their} protégé in establishing spies within the L'eau priesthood. You're quite pleased with the solution you came up with , especially since all the dangerous or incriminating parts can be performed by other people. (see your greensheet “Creating an Unsuspecting Birdie”).  In return, \cAntiChup{} has essentially written you a blank check for support in your bid for the \pFarm{} throne. You intend to cash in big this weekend.

Another ally of yours is \cEvil{\full}, head of the Children of the Sun diplomatic delegation and a ruthless political player. The two of you have been working together for years, though you know full well that \cEvil{}'s ultimate loyalties are only to \cEvil{\them}self.

Of course, there are a lot of other things you could accomplish that would help your position. You could broker a treaty that ends the war (as a teacher, this means being the \textbf{mediator} on a signed treaty). To manage that, you'd need to go toe to toe with \cDiplomat{\full}, who brokered the betrayal of the \pShip{} in the first place, but that just means accomplishing it would be a much more impressive feat. Since the public position of the \pFarm{} is to be against a peace treaty, any such treaty must be \emph{very} beneficial to the \pFarm{}, otherwise it won't count in your favor. At the absolute minimum, a new treaty would need to extend protection from the storm for at least this year since the country is completely unprepared. If you can pull it off, though, you would be a hero, and have the added pleasure of knocking \cDiplomat{} down a peg or two. No one else looms quite as large in the world of diplomacy, except perhaps \cHeadDiplomat{\full} of the \pShip{}. Before the war, at least---now \cHeadDiplomat{} is just a fading star trying to hold on to old glory, as evidenced by the fact that \cHeadDiplomat{\theyare} not leading the L'eau delegation.

You could also bring back one or more sufficiently powerful magical artifacts. The relics are the obvious target, but those will be watched by many people and you are not a particularly accomplished thief. If the opportunity arose to smuggle out a fully charged relic (i.e. one not used for the ritual), you'd probably take it. But with so many skilled magic users around this weekend, you are sure there are other things you could acquire. Any new magical innovation is fair game. If you've got the only working copy, so much the better. Come to think of it, \cCurse{\full} is always working on \emph{something}\ldots{}If whatever \cCurse{\theyare} up to now isn't likely to explode in your face (never a guarantee with \cCurse{}), it might be ideal. You'll just have to make sure it's something that will be a permanent installation in Children of the Sun, under your direction. If Sewell doesn't pan out, maybe you can find something promising among the Free People's Federation students. They are always inventing things.

One thing you never expected to find at the school was romance. But there \cPirate{} was. \cPirate{\They} \cPirate{\are} clever, funny, and reliable, and seeing as \cPirate{\they} hail\cPirate{\plural} from the \pShip{}, \cPirate{\have} no complicated obligations among the \pFarm{} nobility. You'd like very much to take \cPirate{} home with you at the end of all of this and get married. But you aren't entirely sure that \cPirate{} is ready to give up being a teacher at the school, so you'll have to talk about that. Since teachers are supposed to be neutral, it would be a little awkward for the consort of the \cPrince{\heir} apparent of the \pFarm{} to be teaching here. You hope \cPirate{\their} love for you outweighs \cPirate{\their} love of teaching.

This weekend, you also look forward to catching up with your friend \cHedonist{\full}, a \cHedonist{\cleric} from the \pFarm{} with very expensive tastes. \cHedonist{} is a fun person to be around and play a game of chess with (you almost always win), but a bit shallow and a notorious gossip. Still, it is useful for your royal aspirations to have allies in the Church.

Amidst all of your personal plans, as a teacher at the \pSc{}, you technically have duties you should see to. Helping \cBunker{\full} with repairing the magical bunkers is one. This task is at least useful to you---the royal family back home has a not dissimilar bunker, and knowing the ins and outs would allow you to \emph{exploit} any design flaws, should it prove necessary.

It's been five years since you left your home in the royal court of \pFarm{}. Assuming you can reclaim the signet ring, you have a good shot at the throne. But you aren't one to leave things up to chance---you'd much rather stack the deck in your favor. By accomplishing everything you set out to, you can seize that advantage. And the icing on your coronation cake will of course be sharing it all with \cPirate{}.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Reclaim your signet ring. Make sure you leave game with it, as you cannot claim the \pFarm{} throne without it.
\item Broker a treaty that ends the war and that favors \pFarm{} as much as possible, including a stipulation that the Storm will not be sent to your nation at this Time of Deciding, as the consequences would be devastating.
\item Convince \cPirate{} to come home with you and marry you.
\item Acquire one or more magical artifacts, ideally new inventions for which you have the only prototype. Finding out what \cCurse{} is working on, and if it is worth stealing, is a good start. Otherwise, you might try some of the \pTech{} students.
	\item Keep an eye on \cAdopted{}; make sure \cAdopted{\they} \cAdopted{\are} not up to anything inappropriate for a noble, like shirking \cAdopted{\their} duties.
\item Learn as much as you can about how the bunkers work from \cBunker{}, and help with maintaining them.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are the Curse Breaking teacher at the College of the Gods.
	\item You only started teaching at the school 5 years ago, so you were not present for the mess 6 years ago in which the Storm was unexpectedly sent to the \pShip{} out of turn, and the 12 students who directed the Storm perished under mysterious circumstances shortly thereafter.
	\item You think the pirate code phrase you heard was something like, ``Those brave enough chart the course claim the prize.'' Anyone using such language is to be viewed with deep suspicion of being a pirate.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cPirate{}} Your romantic partner. Clever, witty, and politically neutral---ideal marriage material.
	\contact{\cAdopted{}} The adopted scion of a family whose support you hope to court.
	\contact{\cMusic{}} A relative of \cAdopted{}'s adoptive family and a longtime teacher at the College of the Gods. You wish to verify and possibly rekindle \cMusic{\their} loyalty to the Children of the Sun.
	\contact{\cAntiChup{}} An ally in your bid for the throne from the \pTech{}. You supply \cAntiChup{\them} with curses in exchange for blanket support.
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} The most accomplished diplomat attending this weekend. Responsible for the deal between the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} that betrayed the \pShip{}.
	\contact{\cEvil{}} Head of the Children of the Sun advisors/diplomats at this Time of Deciding, and a ruthless political player. A sometime correspondent and ally of yours, though you know full well that \cEvil{}'s ultimate loyalties are only to \cEvil{\them}self.
            \contact{\cHedonist{}} A friend of yours, a \cHedonist{\cleric} from the \pFarm{} with very expensive tastes. A fun person to be around and play a game of chess with (you almost always win), but a bit shallow and a notorious gossip.
