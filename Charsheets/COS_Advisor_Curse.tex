\name{\cCurse{}}

You are \cCurse{} (\cCurse{\they}/\cCurse{\them}), greatest cursemaker in the \pFarm{} at a venerable 72 years old. Not everyone sees you that way -- some insist on considering you a doddering old fool. And it is true -- sometimes your stuff explodes when it wasn’t supposed to. But just as often, you accomplish something previously thought impossible. You are the only commoner among the \pFarm{} delegation as far as you know, and certainly the only one among the advisors. As such, when you are obligated to engage in politics, you consider it your unofficial duty to speak for the commoners.

The problem with being a curse expert is that curses are generally dismissed as the purview of the common folk in \pFarm{}, and most kids with any notable magical talent among the common folk are swept up by the nobility. You were never so lucky. So instead, you learned from the hedge magicians around you, and became quite adept at both curse making and breaking. 

You quite enjoy the creation and casting of curses, and have made quite a few in your storied career. Some are quite mild - a fit of giggles whenever someone attempts to approach their crush, a touch of courage, or a dose of sexual vigor. Some are subtle -- good luck under a waning gibbous moon, or red paint that makes customers want to spend more money. And some are sledgehammers - infertility, locusts, and even memory loss that rivals that of the Gods. In your younger years, you made curses for whoever could pay, all over \pEarth{}, and never thought too hard about what they would be used for. It was just so nice not to be treated like dirt by \pFarm{} nobility that you went, admittedly, a bit wild.

But now there’s a war on, and your country’s war machine is fueled primarily with curses. Your services are in higher demand than ever. You even got to meet the \cQueen{\Majesty} a few years back. But even if you weren't already getting wiser as you got older, war has the kind of moral implication that would make anyone think twice. You have a duty to your country you suppose, but what mostly keeps you supplying curses for the trebuchets is thinking about the generations of pirate raids on the coast -- not to mention the extortion of the coastal \pFarm{} by even the ``good’’ \pShippies{} in exchange for protection from sea serpents. If the \pTech{} really can end the Storms, maybe your country’s treachery will all be worth it.

But according to your sources, that’s a big if. As with many folks on \pEarth{}, you have a variety of penpals. Among them is \cHedonist{}, a \cHedonist{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{}. The two of you have spent long hours discussing what little is known of the \pTech{} plan to end the Storms and debating whether or not it’s actually possible. You are quite keen to vet their claims this weekend, and have a friendly competition going with \cHedonist{} to see who can get to the truth faster. If it turns out that the \pTech{} can’t really end the Storms, then well\ldots you’ve got some serious soul searching to do.

Another penpal of yours is a Teacher at the \pSc{} named \cChupSecond{}. Even since before the war, \cChupSecond{} has occasionally abused the supposed neutrality of teachers at the \pSc{} to trade you some interesting artifact \cChupSecond{\they} \cChupSecond{\have} or another. The most recent was also one of the most interesting in recent months -- an ornately carved wooden box with quite a powerful protection curse on it. You dismantled the curse and opened the box, only to have \cChupSecond{} snatch it away before you caught more than a glint of gold inside. What does \cChupSecond{} know about what was in that box? And what did \cChupSecond{\they} do with it afterwards?

Another penpal of yours is named \cFlowPriest{}. \cFlowPriest{} is another Teacher at the \pSchool{} and quite a delight to discuss magical theory with. \cFlowPriest{} has a most creative and ambitious spark, something \cFlowPriest{\they} credit \cFlowPriest{their} patron \cFlow{\diety}, \cFlowFull{} with. The two of you have been collaborating for several years now on what you expect will be your greatest accomplishment, something that will blow everyone away. The two of you are working on a way to reach the Realm of the Gods, by creating a way to emph{grow} a magical portal overnight. Once complete, people will be able to step through and talk to the Gods face to face. It’s simply emph{genius}! With your presence at the school, you and \cFlowPriest{} expect to put the finishing touches on the project before the weekend’s out.

Of course, beyond getting the opportunity to meet some of your friends, you have other duties to consider as an advisor. You are supposed to be at the negotiating table to discuss treaties and cease-fires and so forth -- which is one of the most boring uses of time you can imagine. You’d much rather be hanging out with the gifted engineer \cBunker{}, shooting the shit about the practicalities of magic and discussing ways to improve and reinforce the blessings already woven into the Bunkers. Maybe \cBunker{\they} will even let you help maintain them if you ask nicely? That’s all to say, unless \cEvil{} forces you for some reason, you’ll be leaving the politics to those who actually enjoy it. You seriously doubt \cEvil{\they} will bother, as \cEvil{} is among the highest ranking nobility and as such has no desire to share power with anyone.

Still, as long as you are here, you might as well see whether any of the students still have a taste for curses -- or if they are all hoity toity nobles who won’t touch the damn things. You’re not exactly looking for a prodigy, but if one happened to fall into your lap, you wouldn’t object. And while you know that \cPrince{} is the curse breaking teacher at the \pSc{}, \cPrince{} is a \cPrince{\heir}, and therefore the most stuck up kind of noble. Even if \cPrince{\they} \cPrince{\were} doing \cPrince{\their} best to teach the students, \cPrince{} can’t possibly be that good at it. All of which is to say, you expect a fair share of curses to be brought to you for removal. Everything has a price though. While you’re happy to charge an arm and a leg to those who can afford it, you’re also willing to show some flexibility for a good cause.

As long as you don’t get roped into too much politicking, this weekend has the potential to be the greatest weekend of your illustrious career. Not only do you have a few mysteries to solve, but together with \cFlowPriest{}, you are going to open the first known portal to the Realm of the Gods! In the meantime, though, you’ve got a reputation to uphold as the greatest cursemaker in the entire \pFarm{} -- no, in all of \pEarth{}. It’ll be tough, but you’re up for the challenge.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Finish the \iBeans{} with \cFlowPriest{}, plant them in time for them to grow, and then visit the Realm of the Gods -- just to say you’ve done it.
	\item Uncover the truth of whether the \pTech{} really can end the Storms. Beat \cHedonist{} to that truth. If it turns out to be true, you’re probably willing to do almost anything to see it realized.
	\item Help \cBunker{} manage the normal wear and tear on the bunkers. See if you can do anything to improve the protections already laid down.
	\item Assist with the myriad of curse making and curse breaking you expect to be afoot this weekend. Uphold your reputation as the greatest curse maker in \pEarth{}!
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item 
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cFlowPriest{}} Your collaborator on the \iBeans{} that will take you to the Realm of the Gods.
	\contact{\cChupSecond{}} Your primary contact at the \pSc{} who trades you interesting artifacts. Not particularly friendly, but you’ve worked together long enough to build a rapport based on \cChupSecond{\them} always being efficient and honest during your dealings.
	\contact{\cHedonist{}} A \cHedonist{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{}. Your friend and casual rival for uncovering the truth behind the \pTech{}’s claim to be able to end the storms.
	\contact{\cEvil{}} The head of the \pFarm{} delegation to the negotiating table. Stuck up like all the rest of the nobility, but at least it means \cEvil{\they} probably won’t drag you to the negotiating table.
	\contact{\cPrince{}} The curse breaking teacher. As a noble, you are sure \cPrince{\they} \cPrince{\are}n’t very good at \cPrince{\their} job. You expect to need to step in and help, assuming \cPrince{} will let you.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} A brilliant engineer who you hope to work with and talk magical theory with this weekend.
\end{contacts}

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

Ghost commissioned to make a "curse" by the warlord's wife more...vigorious / dominant / etc (curse version of viagra) but language is vague and gets misconstrued.  So instead make something that makes warlord aggressive and angry / firebrand / etc, starts the war (confirm Ghost's sheet to ensure he's OK with this)

Eccentric, esoteric magician type
I’m a eccentric hedgewizard and sometimes I fuck up but other times I accomplish things NO ONE ELSE CAN DOOOOO!!!!
Crazy inventor, also sometimes explosions

Needs mechanic for flipping a coin to see whether he helps or hinders
Other people call him a hedge wizard, but he calls himself something like “The Marlin!”
