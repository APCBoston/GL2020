Only the best of the best are invited to teach at the \pSchool{}. Being a teacher at the \pSc{} is a tremendous honor and a tremendous responsibility. It is also a careful balancing act. You are ostensibly neutral, having shed any national ties when you accepted the teaching position here. Some few teachers make a serious effort to actually achieve impartiality -- but most retain close contacts via correspondence, and keep careful tabs on domestic and international politics.

A large number of teachers resigned after the tragic incident six years ago in which the twelve students who remained for the Time of Deciding all died mysteriously after the Ritual to Control the Storm. Therefore, a lot of teachers present are relatively new hires, arriving at the school between 4 and 6 years ago. Even for teachers who have been teaching longer, it is not common for the same teachers to be chosen to stay for the Time of Deciding many times in a row. Most prefer to go home to their families during this uncertain time.

Those of the staff who do stay at the \pSc{} during the Time of Deciding have a multifaceted challenge ahead. You must prepare the Ritual to Control the Storm, lest the magic get out of hand and do even more damage than a controlled Storm would. You must guide the students, and provide a buffer between them and the Advisors, who often forget that the students are human beings, not just pawns in a game of high stakes chess. You must preserve the veneer of impartiality. And you must weigh its value against the risk that people dear to you could die if the Storm is sent to your home nation.

You are not in this alone. Every teacher at the Time of Deciding is trying to find the same balance. You can and should be a resource for each other as you navigate this time. All of you have been colleagues for years, some for decades. Who better to hold your moments of doubt than another teacher, or the immortal Principal? But it's probably best if the students don't hear you doubting. They look up to you for assurance and stability.

You will almost certainly need to field concerns around the ethics and morality of one decision or another. You may find yourself questioning, or be called on to defend the traditions of the \pSc{}, the nations, and the religion. How will you support your favorite students? How will you protect your homeland? And how will you make \pEarth{} a better place?

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Decide how you will rank the students from a different nation for the purposes of who will receive the most votes to direct the Storm. You will need to spend some time evaluating the students to determine which you think deserve the most votes. Teachers mostly start out with opinions about students from their own nation, and therefore will need to discuss with the teachers who are ranking those students to make their opinions known. Submit your rankings by 9 pm on Saturday night. See your greensheet for details. 
	\item Prepare the Ritual to Control the Storm, and then execute your part in the ritual itself. Ensure the students are participating in the preparations as well. the librarian, \cLibrarian{\full} is normally in charge of ensuring this vital task is completed, but the work requires many hands, and so any and all who are interested are encouraged to assist.
	\item Attend the Ceremony of Excellence to support the students.
	\item Two of your colleagues, \cMusic{\full} and \cBeetle{\full}, are competing to become the next Principal of the \pSc{}, a decision which will affect you greatly. Decide which of them you support, and make your preferences known to the current Principal, \cPrincipal{\full}.
	\item Preserve the school, and its traditions.
