\name{\cMusic{}}

You are \cMusic{\full} (\cMusic{\they}/\cMusic{\them}), and you are 50 years old. You are from \pFarm{} and work as the Music teacher at the \pSchool{}. You are a devout follower of \cFarmGod{} and your spirituality is an important part of who you are. You are caring, approachable, and devoted to the well being of all in your care. The balance of the world was broken 6 years ago, and you are in a position to help fix it now---so that's just what you intend to do.

Your early life was easy, since your family is old, landed nobility. You had the best education possible, including several focus programs. In one about the religions of \pEarth{}, you were assigned a pen pal in \pTech{}. \cBeetle{\full} and you were a surprisingly good match, and you maintained your correspondence long after the program ended.

With several elder siblings, you had always had the freedom to explore what called to you. You came to love music from a young age, and it was the first thing that drew you to the church. You spent several years studying the spiritual and healing practice of music and preparing to enter the Priesthood, encouraged by your family for the status boost it would have provided, only to realize that your true calling lay in teaching. Your family was initially disappointed---teaching being a noble profession, but nowhere near as prestigious as joining the Priesthood---but were ultimately appeased when you landed a position as the Music teacher at the \pSchool{} 18 years ago. To your personal delight \cBeetle{} joined the faculty the same year! Marriage has never appealed to you, but you consider every student who passes through the school to be one of your children and care for them as deeply as if they were your own flesh and blood.

Teaching music to students from all three nations has taken some getting used to. Not all music has healing magic, but all \pFarm{} healing magic is musical; therefore, all music is holy to those of your nation. You've come to understand that isn't so in the other nations, so you try not to be too heavy handed about it, but it is still important to you to instill some reverence into your students. Sometimes you wonder about how tightly the priesthood restricts access to healing music in your homeland. Would it really be so bad for other \pFarmers{} who held the power in proper awe to be able to use it to take care of each other?

After 12 years at the \pSchool{}, you were feeling pretty comfortable in your life, but then everything seemed to go wrong at once. After the ritual to control the storm was completed, the students were tired but jubilant. Someone proposed a toast---not an unusual occurrence---but somehow the idea was circulated that the students should toast in private. So they all adjourned from the Ritual Space to the Student Lounge, leaving the teachers and advisors on their own. After nearly an hour of waiting, \cDiplomat{\full}, \cPrincipal{\full}, and you decided to go check on the students. What you found was 11 dead bodies. A quick inspection indicated that it was probably the wine. But the twelfth student, your star pupil and personal favorite \cKidScientist{\full}, was unaccounted for. The three of you stood in that room, the shock washing over you. Was \cKidScientist{} responsible? Or was it someone else's doing? The three of you spoke quietly, and ultimately agreed to keep the fact that \cKidScientist{} was not among the dead a secret. You simply could not believe that one of your children, let alone gentle \cKidScientist{}, could have been responsible for this. It was more likely that someone else had poisoned the students, \cKidScientist{} had managed to escape, and, not knowing who to trust, had fled for \cKidScientist{\their} life. Keeping it out of public knowledge that \cKidScientist{\they} escaped would avoid anyone continuing to hunt \cKidScientist{\them}. \cKidScientist{\They}'d have a chance. And if \cKidScientist{\they} wanted to surface and return to the public eye, \cKidScientist{\they} could do so in \cKidScientist{\their} own time. The rest is history---in sending the Storm to the \pShip{}, the decades-old international treaty between the three nations was broken, the \pShip{} were betrayed, and a war started soon after. After you emerged from your grief over the lost children, you realized that it was time to take a more active role in the world around you.

Since the ritual to control the Storm went awry six years ago, you have taken a significant interest in ensuring that this crucial event goes smoothly and that the right students participate and vote wisely. To that end, you've volunteered to be on the committee preparing the ritual at the last Time of Deciding and this one. Under your watchful eye, matters have gone well, and you know \cPrincipal{\full} appreciates your efforts in ensuring the safety and success of the students. While nobody could reasonably solve all of this themselves, you know as a teacher that your best way to make a difference is to take on a greater role in guiding the students' morals and helping them to decide the solutions that would best preserve their futures.

When \cPrincipal{} announced at the beginning of the year that \cPrincipal{\they} would be retiring, you knew that you were meant to take over the role and immediately applied. You are \emph{pretty sure} you want the principal position. There is a downside---as long as you serve in that role, you cannot leave the school grounds without terrible consequences to the school. Cheering you on in this endeavor is one of your favorite students, \cDisney{\full}, a bright and idealistic young \cDisney{\person} from the \pFarm{}. Alas your old friend \cBeetle{} is your competition for the role. In order to help \cPrincipal{} decide who to select, \cPrincipal{\they} \cPrincipal{\have} asked each of you to oversee an important task that normally falls to the Principal during the Time of Deciding. Your task is to oversee the arrangements for this year's Ceremony of Excellence. Part of that will mean selecting students, teachers, and advisors to participate in the various parts of the ceremony, and there are multiple people who are interested in each role. The only one you feel strongly about is \cHedonist{}, who is a sorry excuse for a Priest of Luminary, interested in nothing but hedonistic pleasures; you do not want to see them give the Advisorâ€™s speech at the ceremony. You know \cPrincipal{} is both counting on you and judging your performance in this task against \cBeetle{}'s. Your friendship, built over the years, has only deepened during your time working together at \pSchool{}. Of all the people to lose to, \cBeetle{} is a pretty good alternative.

A much newer friend of yours at the school, with whom you don't currently have any rivalry, is \cInterpol{\full}. A fellow teacher from the \pFarm{}, \cInterpol{} has been here for 4 years and you helped show \cInterpol{\them} the ropes when \cInterpol{\they} first arrived. \cInterpol{\They} teach\cInterpol{\pluralC} magical combat, a subject you find somewhat antithetical to your own, but you don't let that come between you. \cInterpol{} shares your deep love of music, and you've had many a great conversation about musical theory.

You've also been paying special attention to \cAdopted{\full}, the adopted \cAdopted{\child} of your \cAdoptedParentOne{\nibling} (making \cAdopted{} your grand \cAdopted{\nibling}). You've known \cAdopted{} at a distance ever since \cAdopted{\they} \cAdopted{\were} young, and \cAdopted{\they} seem\cAdopted{\plural} to genuinely like you. Since coming to the school, \cAdopted{\theyare} far closer with you than with any other family member. Which isn't necessarily saying much, since \cAdopted{} still chafes under the adoption arrangement and seems to resent the rest of the family. You think \cAdopted{} is being needlessly harsh, but you still sympathize with \cAdopted{\their} situation and wish there was something you could do to help; unfortunately, you are not \cAdopted{\their} legal guardian, and your \cAdoptedParentOne{\nibling} hasn't been willing to alter the terms of the adoption. If push came to shove, you could appeal to \cPrince{\full} to draft adoption papers---as long as they are sealed with the royal signet ring, they would be be binding. You worry sometimes that \cAdopted{} might try something drastic, and you don't want anyone getting hurt. You think \cAdopted{\their} friend \cLibAssist{\full} is a bad influence; perhaps the two should be separated somehow. \cAdopted{} has been performing admirably in your music class; maybe you can connect with \cAdopted{\them} further through music and coax \cAdopted{\them} away from such bad influences. You want to be there to support \cAdopted{} however you can. Another way you can do so is by convincing the teachers from the \pTech{} to rank \cAdopted{\them} highest for voting authority to direct the Storm.

With less than three days remaining before the voting and the Ritual to Control the Storm, all of your hard work is coming together. Soon you'll see the fruits of your labor in the form of a promotion, increased hope for balance in the world, and a successful conclusion to the school year. Assuming, of course, that everything goes according to plan.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Ensure that the preparations for the Ritual to Control the Storm go off without a hitch.
	\item Encourage the students to show compassion in their voting on where to direct the Storm and undo the betrayal of the \pShip{}.
	\item Win the promotion to Principal. Pursuant to that, put on a phenomenal Ceremony of Excellence (see greensheet for details). This will help with impressing \cPrincipal{}.
	\item Help \cAdopted{} win the highest voting authority by convincing the teachers from the \pTech{} to rank \cAdopted{\them} highest.
	\item Figure out why \cAdopted{} feels so resentful about being adopted, and make sure \cAdopted{\they} \cAdopted{\does}n't do anything drastic about it.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item Musical healing magic in \pFarm{} is strictly controlled by the Priesthood and licensed for use only to a select few outside of it. If only more of \cFarmGod{}'s people could rejoice in the gifts of their God in this way! You are one of the select few with such a license from the Church of \cFarmGod{}, since you teach music to students of all nations.
	\item You were here at the \pSchool{} 6 years ago. You are one of the 3 people who know the truth, that only 11 students were actually killed that day, and that the twelfth, \cKidScientist{\full}, remains at large.
	\item \cKidScientist{\full} was your favorite student six years ago. \cKidScientist{\They} vanished when the other 11 students were murdered. You agreed to conceal the fact that \cKidScientist{}'s body was never found, and a small part of you still hopes that \cKidScientist{\theyare} still out there somewhere.
