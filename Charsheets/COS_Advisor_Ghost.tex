%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the character's current life, problems, and priorities. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life. Current life and situation.   What they think about the most important contacts

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.
Ghost commissioned to make a "curse" by the warlord's wife more...vigorious / dominant / etc (curse version of viagra) but language is vague and gets misconstrued.  So instead make something that makes warlord aggressive and angry / firebrand / etc, starts the war (confirm Ghost's sheet to ensure he's OK with this)
