\name{\cEthics{}}

You are \cEthics{} (\cEthics{\they}/\cEthics{\them}), and a teacher at the \pSchool{}. You teach Ethics and Morality, which is quite the load to bear right now, given how unethically so many powerful people in \pEarth{} are behaving. You’ve found yourself bending more and more rules to stay true to your moral compass, and you only hope you can hold it together through this weekend -- with a possible end to a senseless war, now is no time to fall apart.

You grew up in the \pTech{}. Your family lived in a poor neighborhood, but scraped together enough money to send you and your younger sibling to good schools. The merit scholarships you collected along the way certainly didn’t hurt. Even from a young age, the disparities were obvious between your family and others in the neighborhood. It was enough to keep you up at night, thinking about what made someone \emph{good}. For years you thought, wrote, debated, and advocated for change in the \pTech{}. After getting fed up with your well marshaled arguments falling on the deaf ears of the council, you decided to turn to teaching instead.

You started teaching at the \pSc{} 20 years ago. Two years into your career, you were approached by one of the advisors from the \pFarm{}. \cEvil{\They} indicated a need for utmost secrecy to help save a life. Once you understood the situation -- someone was hunting \cEvil{}’s family for political gains -- you agreed to take \cEvil{\their} child and hide \cPirateChild{\them}. You reached out to \cPirate{}, a teacher brand new to the school at the time, and a person you’d grown to be fast friends with. \cPirate{\They} still had a lot of connections in \pShip{}, where yours from \pTech{} had already started to atrophy. \cPirate{} agreed to take the child and find \cPirateChild{\them} a good home. It hurt your heart to just send the child off to an unknown fate, but there was nothing for it -- the best way to keep the child safe was to hide \cPirateChild{\them} as well as possible. 

In honor of that wayward child, you do your best to shelter and support every student that comes to the school. You are firm with your boundaries, but are as kind and understanding as possible. You relish helping students work through their moral quandaries and have become somewhat of a popular person to ask for advice. You try to instill in each of your students the idea that ethics should be subservient to morality and that tradition is no reason to withhold justice. Among the current crop of students, you find \cAmbition{} and \cTechStar{} particularly promising. The former has the will and the drive to make change, if you could just point \cAmbition{\them} in the right direction. The latter is one of the most brilliant minds you’ve had under your care at the \pSc{} in your whole career. And they have \emph{ideas} about equality that you mean to nurture.

The first big test of morality your students’ face is the vote to direct the storm. You thought you were doing pretty well with the students six years ago -- but when the votes were revealed, and the \pShip{} betrayed, you were horrified. And then to lose every one of them to an unsolved murder? You nearly quit on the spot out of depression at your own failure. But no. You had to stand firm. You had to stay, and try harder for the next group. While you loathe whoever orchestrated this betrayal, your primary concern right now is to help your current students find the light -- and you have the strong hope that the student’s this year could be made of stern enough stuff to right the wrong wrought six years ago. If the students refuse to support the ongoing treaty between the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}, the advisors may be persuaded to make reparations to the \pShip{} and re-establish some form of the original treaty that governed the Storm.

One of your biggest opponents in this is \cPrince{\full}. \cPrince{} is one of \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{}’s many children, and a terrible person. And you don’t say that lightly. The \cQueen{\Majesty} has a twisted sense of morality, and it seems that \cPrince{} completely shares it. When you first met \cPrince{\them}, it didn’t seem like that much of an issue -- but now that \cPrince{\they} are making open moves to be named crown \cPrince{\Heir} over the \cQueen{\Majesty}’s firstborn, it’s a bigger concern. You aren’t quite sure what you can do to stop \cPrince{}, but you’ve got to think of something. You dread to think how much worse the viper’s nest of \pFarm{} court life could get with \cPrince{} in charge.

You also intend to take a more active role in preparing the ritual itself. The care and handling of the Relics is critical. If prepared and cared for incorrectly, the Relics could cause the magic to go out of control, and the Storm to go somewhere not intended.

Normally the ritual is arranged by the Librarian, \cLibrarian{}, but that’s not going to be possible this time. \cLibrarian{} lost most of \cLibrarian{\their} memories on \cLibrarian{\their} last holiday. You know this because just before going on holiday, \cLibrarian{} broke up with you. The whole story was a complete mess. \cLibrarian{\They} came into your office rather suddenly on the end of the last day of term, and demanded to know whether you were cheating on \cLibrarian{\them} -- with \cChupSecond{}, of all people. You denied the blatantly false accusation, but \cLibrarian{} started ranting about how \cChupAvenger{} had confirmed it. You were just working out how you could possibly explain your involvement in the black market to \cLibrarian{} without \cLibrarian{\them} dumping you anyway, but \cLibrarian{\they} stormed out before you could. \cLibrarian{\They} were off the island and on \cLibrarian{\their} way home in a heartbeat, all without hearing you out.

You spent that holiday agonizing over how to fix things. You never meant to get this involved in the black market, but when all the legal avenues are blocked, it is a moral obligation to use an illegal one to make necessary change. You originally got involved dealing information, feeding bits and pieces into the \pShip{} spy network, in hopes of giving the \pShippies{} the upper hand in the war for long enough that \pFarm{} and \pTech{} would agree to a ceasefire, and ultimately a just treaty that makes up for the wrongs done these past six years. Now you are involved in many more things -- helping pass information, technology, and even food to people in desperate need of it. You’ve also been acquiring and returning artifacts of great meaning to minority groups that had been ``discovered'' by powerful people and taken to museums, thus depriving the original community of their heirlooms. You were pretty sure that you had kept your involvement a secure secret, since you have been using \cLibrarian{}’s assistant, \cLibAssist{} to pass information back and forth between you and \cChupSecond{} -- but \cLibrarian{} must have noticed how many errands \cLibAssist{} was running on your behalf and gotten suspicious. But cheating? Seriously? Why would \cChupAvenger{} tell \cLibrarian{} that?

When term began again, you plucked up your courage and went to see \cLibrarian{} again, first thing. But to your shock and dawning horror, \cLibrarian{\They} didn’t even recognize you. You hustled \cLibrarian{\them} off to the library and into \cLibrarian{\their} private office, where you quickly ascertained that \cLibrarian{}’s memory was almost entirely gone. Which could only mean murder. But \cLibrarian{} wouldn’t hurt a fly! Without just cause, at least\ldots But the Gods are never wrong. Murder must have been done. But surely it was just? And if it was just, why should \cLibrarian{} suffer such punishment? The morality of punishing someone for a just deed aside, \cLibrarian{} would surely lose \cLibrarian{\their} job if anyone found out. You resolved to do everything you could to cover for \cLibrarian{\their} secret.

You thought about telling \cLibrarian{} about the relationship, about the break up, and about the accusations. But the accusations were false. You squinted at the situation and decided that it was morally acceptable \emph{not} to remind \cLibrarian{} of falsehoods \cLibrarian{\they} once believed. Instead, you have simply begun courting \cLibrarian{} anew.

To keep your mind off of considering the morality of your decision too hard, you have begun engaging with your \pShip{} student, \cWarlordDaughter{}. \cWarlordDaughter{} is key to ending the war in your opinion. Even once the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} are ready to discuss reparations for the \pShippies{}, the \pShip{} must also be willing to come to the negotiating table. Your best chance for insight into the warlike \cLoud{\full} is \cLoud{\their} \cWarlordDaughter{\child}, \cWarlordDaughter{}.

This weekend, there is a war to end, and countless injustices to set on a path to healing. As one of the school’s most beloved teachers, you have the ability to influence the students to make the right choice, and advocate for an end to the war. On a more personal note, you need to figure out what you are going to do about \cLibrarian{}, and whether you will continue your involvement with the black market.
