%Vikings are at war
%Add things from world doc that I was supposed to port over

%% Add a bit about how the war is bad, we're already getting pounded, but the Pirates are insult to injury.

The \pFarmers{} are a people gifted with plenty.  Bounded by mountains to the North and ocean on every other side, they live on a large watershed ripe with farmlands and teeming with birds and wildlife.  The Mediterranean sun blesses the land and those who work it with \cFarmGod{}’s light.   

\section*{Form of government}

\pFarm{} are ruled by a monarchy and are currently under the governance of \cQueen{\full}, considered by many to be a wise and benevolent leader.  With \cQueen{\their} Consort at \cQueen{\their} side and advised by a panel of Councilors, \cQueen{\they} presides over the noble Lords and Ladies of the country - wealthy landowners and mages.  She passes down the laws of the land and ensures that the nobility uphold their obligations and responsibilities toward their people and their lands.

The rules of succession dictate that the eldest child of the reigning monarch inherits.  Whoever they marry doesn't automatically take on the title of ruler, but instead becomes a Consort of the current ruler. Should the partnership be dissolved, the Consort does not retain any titles of King or Queen and any future children they have are not considered eligible for the throne.  For the purposes of inheritance, gender is irrelevant.  In recorded history, there have been times when a younger child of the reigning monarch is deemed the most fit to be Heir and the eldest has been passed over, but such events are very rare and tend to cause unrest.

The Nobility preside over their lands and the people who live on and work them, none of whom own any land themselves.  For the purposes of day to day management, the Nobility typically designate one or more trusted individuals to oversee their lands during their absences.  On their own lands, the Nobility's words are law - so long as they don't contradict the queen's edicts.  Nobility are even in charge of how the Priesthood interacts with the workers to some extent, so services such as education and healing provided by the Priesthood vary from one region to the next.

%GM Note: The Queen is beloved by many, but she works hard to keep it that way.  Those who oppose the Queen have a habit of quietly disappearing or dying of seemingly natural causes or unfortunate accidents.

\section*{Major industries, Economy, and Trade}

The major industry of \pFarm{} is agriculture -- with their vast, rich farmlands, enhanced every spring by the mages amongst the nobility, the \pFarmers{} produce enough food to feed not only themselves but also \pTech{} to the North.  In return for the traded food, they receive technology from \pTech{} that allow them to continue their mass production of food.  Until the war with the \pShippies{} began, \pFarm{} produced enough surplus to supply to their nation as well.  In return for food, they were provided with fish for fertilizers and protection from the sea serpents.  While the newest innovations in farming technology from \pTech{} make up some of the difference, the fish-based fertilizers from \pShip{} are sorely missed. As such, times have been difficult for the seaside holdings between serpent attacks and \pShip{} raids.

For most of the \pFarmers{}, it is a time of plenty, but the farmlands which were once natively fertile have become weary from decades of constant, unsustainably exuberant growth.  Without the technology of \pTech{} and the flood of magics from the nobility of \pFarm{} every year, the land would collapse into dustbowl and famine.

\section*{Politics, International Relations, and Immigration}

Eight years ago, diplomats from \pTech{} came to \pFarm{} with the offer of a new alliance.  On the brink of inventing tech that would allow for the permanent removal of storms while still retaining the use of magic, the scientists of \pTech{} needed a little more time to finish their research - time they wouldn’t have if they were occupied by preparations for the upcoming Storm.  With the promise of this new technology, \cQueen{} agreed to form a new alliance with the \pTech{}, with whom they agreed to send the storms exclusively towards \pShip{} so that the two nations could have the available resources to pursue this invention for the good of all nations in the long term.  In the aftermath of the betrayal six years ago, the L'eau declared war on both of the allied nations in hopes of claiming safe land and punishing those who had wronged them.  

The war has come at great cost for the \pFarm{}, as the \pShippies{} are far better equipped for war, since their ships were already equipped for hunting the monsters of the sea, and they are no longer protecting the \pFarm{} from the sea dragons.  A few of the Noble families whose lands border the coast and the \pShip{} settlements have attempted to speak for them to \cQueen{}, but so far \cQueen{\they} has decided that the benefits of the continued alliance with \pTechies{} and continued safety of the \pFarm{} from the storms outweighs the cost to the \pShip{} and loss of protection.

Over time, the \pFarm{} have adapted offensive spells to defend their lands and people - using ill luck curses, charms to attract dangerous sea creatures, and other indirect means of targeting the warships to avoid incurring \cFarmGod{}’s wrath.

Despite the war, the alliance between the \pFarm{} and \pTech{} has lead to an unprecedented period of growth for the \pFarmers{} - it has been nine years since they were last hit by the storms, and the guaranteed safety from the storms has meant that they have been able to dedicate themselves to agricultural expansion and improvements, rather than focusing on preparations and fortifications for the next coming storm.  Should things continue as the leaders of \pTech{} suggest, with the magic and technology of \pTech{}, soon the storms will hopefully be rectified altogether.  Once \pTech{} finish their technology, the \pShip{} will realize that this was all for the greater good - the \pShip{} don't have the responsibility of providing food for multiple nations or producing lifesaving technology, and aren't as dependent on magic in the first place.

%Something unpleasant should befall one of the Noble families who spoke out against the Queen's treatment of the Vikings - starting with that family, those who went to see her and speak out against their treatment begin to suffer unpleasant accidents and unfortunate circumstances.  

Immigration to \pFarm{} is uncommon, but welcome.  Unlike the stringent requirements of the other two nations, the \pFarm{} will take you as you are, so long as you are willing to work and work hard.  Unless the person migrating is possessed of a great skill or talent that is considered of cultural use, they will typically find themselves working the lands.  Immigration away from \pFarm{} is more rare.  The \pFarmers{} strongly discourage members of their society from immigrating away.  It is considered borderline blasphemous to travel to \pTech{} for the regular auditions - gifts of magecraft are needed to ensure the seeds sprout every spring, and gifts of music are sacred and contained within the priesthood.  As for immigration to \pShip{} - it is a fantasy worthy of children to want to run away to a \pShippies{} ship, but the realities of \pShip{} life are hard and dangerous.  Who would trade a peaceful life on solid ground under the gifts of the Sun for the unpredictability and danger of the sea?  Those who fail at both endeavors must return home to the lost standing in the eyes of their families and neighbors.

%GM Note: Often those who return are not welcomed back into their old Fiefdoms.  It is generally easier to travel to a different Fiefdom and start a new life than to face the ostracization from your peers and disownment of your family.  There are those who will pretend they are immigrating from a different country rather than be condemned as failures.

\section*{Educational system}

The wealthy offspring of the Nobility are educated by private tutors, hired to give them a thorough grounding in a variety of subjects, including magic, religion, reading, writing, geography, history, mathematics, and governance.  Their tutors include members of the priesthood and the younger children of nobility without strong magical talents of their own.  The children of the wealthiest families are even tutored by members of the Federation.

Many members of the nobility see themselves as the caretakers of the people who live and work their lands.  As the priests say, the working class are the closest to the earth and are therefore closest to the gods, even if their work is full of hardship.  The farmworkers are educated by members of the priesthood.  Lessons are given to children until the age of twelve, when the majority join their parents in learning their trades.  A select few join the priesthood and continue their lessons - whether because they feel called to the work, are scholastically inclined, don't want to work in manual labor all their lives, have a disability that prevents such work, or to fulfill a love of art or music by channeling it through service to the Gods.

\subsection*{School attendees}

The majority of the students sent to the \pSchool{} are the children of the reigning monarch or those of the Nobility. Occasionally, however, a child with magic will be born to a working class family.  When these children are discovered, they are taken in by the nobility for tutelage.  On the rare occasion that they show especially promising talents, they can be sponsored to go to the \pSchool{}.

\section*{Cultural taboos / social norms}
The \pFarm{} have a number of cultural norms. Almost everyone is vegetarian for religious reasons. Children are cherished and it is expected that if you are able to have them, you will. If you are unable or unwilling to have children, you are still expected to participate in child rearing, and there is a lot of social pressure to adopt.

Every culture has taboos. For the \pFarmers{}, one of the most important is cruelty or physical harm to animals and sentient living beings. It is a grave offense to create music or art outside of the priesthood. Lesser taboos include choosing not to have children or be involved in child-rearing, and choosing to emigrate away and abandon your family and responsibilities.


\subsection*{Gender, Sexuality, Relationships, and Family Structure}

For \pFarm{}, gender is largely irrelevant when it comes to social standing or societal roles. In some families, the firstborn inherits regardless of magical ability; for others, a sufficiently powerful younger child may have a chance superseding their older sibling. For the noble classes, children are expected to pair with at least one partner who is compatible for procreation, said partner also expected to be gifted in magecraft. Though this partly stems from desires to continue on the family lines, it also stems from a need to provide for the futures of their lands and their peoples -- without mages, the seeds will not sprout in the spring and the land will collapse into famine. Unfortunately, strong magical talents are not common in children even through careful selection of partners, so the nobility tend to have large family structures.  Older strong magical talents inherit, younger strong magical talents are married to nobility in other lands in a complex diplomatic dance. Children without magical talents of their own or without strong enough talents to attract a strong-magical partner either find a place for themselves as a caretaker of the estate, an educator, or join the priesthood.

For the working classes, family structures are more flexible.  Children are considered a communal responsibility - adults are free to partner with whomever they wish, but it is frowned upon to choose to be childless.  With the majority of adults working on the farm during the daylight hours, caregiving responsibilities are shared throughout the community.  Single, double, and multiple adult households are all common.       
 
\subsection*{Cultural foods}

The food of the \pFarm{} is a food rich in herbs and spices.  While they may preserve some herbs and spices for sale and shipment to the wealthier people in \pTech{}, the goods do not maintain their full flavor after the preservation process.  Generally one has to travel to \pFarm{} to experience the full depth of flavor that can be found in the dishes of even the most humble of homes.  The food of the \pFarmers{} is also mostly vegetarian, due to the prohibition of their God against the killing or harming of other nonhuman beings.  The people who live along the coasts may trade locally for fish with the \pShip{} settlements, but otherwise none of the \pFarm{} consume meat.

%GM Note - As embedded into their culture as their rich and flavorful foods are the many varied poisons cultivated, brewed, and distilled by \pFarmers{}.  Publicly this is seen through the varied pesticides and deterrents sprayed on crops and warding dwellings.  Silently, this is seen as an every varying and mutating range of poisons to disable or destroy, deployed through ingestion, inhalation, or simply through skin contact.  

\section*{Religion}

The Priesthood, keepers of the faith, are also the healers and educators of the nation.  Sacred music is used heal, and zealously guarded.  The use or creation of music by others is forbidden by the Priesthood, although the traveling circuses from \pTech{} are outside these rules, hence some of their popularity.

Hummingbirds are considered sacred to the \pFarmers{}, for they are the oracles of the many-faceted God of \pFarm{}.  Ranging in size from the nail of one's thumb to the size of small carts, their song contains the messages of the God.  Monasteries plant special flowers and sweet-smelling herbs known to be especially pleasing to hummingbirds, and many in the Priesthood study music their entire lives to commune with the oracles and please \cFarmGod{} with their songs.

All living creatures are under the care and protection of \cFarmGod{}, from the lowliest pill bug to the most majestic stag.  None are permitted to be harmed or killed by \pFarm{} without facing severe punishment from \cFarmGod{}.  Because of this, the people of \pFarm{} work diligently to maintain the ecological balance of their farmlands, ensuring that aphids and other living pests are kept under control by their own predators such as ladybugs and birds and discouraged through the use of curses and selective poisons.  After all, how can the harm be traced if the deed is done by magic?  

\subsection*{Magic}

In \pFarm{}, magic is the gift and responsibility of the nobility. Publically, only members of the noble classes have magic, and care is taken by each family to ensure that this gift continues amongst their children.  It is common for courtship rituals amongst the nobility to include demonstrations and displays of magical talent.  On the occasion, a child with magical abilities will be found amongst the working class - perhaps from an extraordinary ability to coax life into stubborn seeds or from a demonstration of healing when one of the farm animals or other farm workers becomes injured or sick.  Should the child attract the attention of the nobility, they are brought into the household of the overlord or local nobility for education. In order to avoid any \emph{distractions} from their studies, the children are strongly discouraged from contacting their birth family.  If they are particularly magically gifted, , the child may be sponsored to go to \pSchool{}.  Should the child be discovered early enough, they are often formally adopted into the household as another son or daughter and may not even be told the truth of their heritage.  It is for the good of all to fully remove the child from their family as soon as possible - after all, unfortunate or malevolent things are known to happen when magical talents crop up where they do not belong.  

The gift of magic is one that comes with a heavy responsibility - that of ensuring that all people in multiple countries remain fed.  Every spring, the mages of each fiefdom go down to the farmlands to push their magic into the lands and seeds prepared by the farm workers.  Each and every seed is imbued with magic, allowing them to sprout and causing them to grow two to three times as quickly and as bountifully as they would otherwise do.  Every plant is pest free, every fruit and vegetable free from fungi or rot that would blight the harvest.  It is exhausting but vital work.

However, their farmlands are dependent on this magic - the land is exhausted (and has been for centuries). It is only the magic continuing to flow into the land that returns strength to it each year. Were the magic to cease to flow into the land, it is theorized that all plant life would die as the dirt itself turned dust.

In recent years, the nobility amongst the \pFarm{} assisting with the war efforts have turned to a type of magic previously (and often still) scorned -- curses.  Previously the domain of those hedgemages amongst the working class who grow up without attracting the attention of the Nobility, the Nobility have long considered curseworking to be plebeian and unsophisticated.  While some insist on calling curses providing “beneficial” effects to be blessings, all small magics both beneficial and negative are considered to fall under the label of curses.  With the power of the \pFarm{} mages behind them, however, these small curses have been able to sink ships and cause \pShip{} weaponry to misfire.

\subsection*{Crime and Punishment}

While small crimes and misdemeanors are punished by society, there are some crimes which are considered so blasphemous by \cFarmGod{} that, if they are committed, the world itself will enact punishment regardless of whether the crime was observed or not.

Although all Gods punish murder of humans with the removal of one's conscious memories, the God of \pFarm{} considers all living creatures to be worthy of such protection.  Birds, fish, mammals, bugs - all creatures which walk, crawl, fly, or swim are precious to the God.  Those \pFarm{} who live near the settlements of the \pShip{} and eat fish are careful not to trade for live fish, but to only accept fish post-death.

Abuse to animals is also strongly punished.  Should someone intentionally starve their animals, kick their pets, or beat their livestock, they will receive the same as they laid upon their animals but tenfold.  Whispers are told of people who intentionally squashed a beetle on their plants, only to have a giant boulder hurtle from the sky and squash them where they stood.  While families work hard to ensure that their children learn this lesson early, it is known that \cFarmGod{} is lenient towards youth.  Should a six year old accidentally crush an earthworm in their enthusiastic grasp, they are likely to get a peck and a scold from a nearby hummingbird. 

\section*{Costuming Related Items}

The \pFarm{} amongst all social strata are a people in love with color - all members of society, from the poorest farm worker to the wealthiest among the nobility, dress in a multitude of gem-like hues.  Dye-making is almost an art amongst the working class and special washes are brewed from local plants to make colorful garments difficult to stain.  Embroidery and needlework are pastimes for winter months and garments are often embellished.  Common motifs include flowers, leaves, and the sacred hummingbird.

\section*{Opinions about People from the Other Nations}

Uncouth and mercenary, the \pShippies{} are a warlike people - unstructured and with no respect for tradition, they go wherever the wind takes them.  They have no respect for tradition - they let \emph{14-year-olds} help with decision making.  Fourteen year olds!  They aren’t old enough to provide any kind of relevant input into the future of a nation - these spring green sprouts need to buckle down and learn the practicalities of the world before they start thinking about voicing their opinions about politics.

While some might daydream about joining the \pShippies{}, it is a dream for children.   The lure of freedom may be tempting, but at the end of the day, the sun doesn’t shine as bright without the sturdy roots of tradition under your feet.

The \pTech{} are a nation of grand ideas and even grander technology - but they are scandalously free with music and the trading caravans skirt blasphemy with their performances.  One mustn’t let young, impressionable children get too close to the performances, or their blasphemy may be catching.  The \pTech{} are also often very high and mighty - hautily, they look down on the \pFarm{} and the labors and products of the earth.  Only the poorest among them dein to wear clothing made from wool, flax, or cotton.

Still, they are reliable allies and solid trading partners. It would be wrong to think too harshly of those that have been staunch allies for a bloody war.
