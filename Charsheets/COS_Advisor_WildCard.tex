\name{\cWildCard{}}

You are \cWildCard{\full} (\cWildCard{\they}/\cWildCard{\them}), and 42 years old. You are ostensibly here to support \cEvil{}, represent the will of \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{}in the negotiations to try to end the war, and study the Relics of \pEarth{}. In reality you are more interested in gaining immortality, and everything you need to achieve it is here on this floating island.

You are a scholar of \pFarm{} -- one of the country’s best. You come from a wealthy, noble family - not as long as some, but not newly landed either. You attended the \pSchool{} in your youth and are now an expert in the history and theory of magic -- which means that unlike some, you know that there are many things that are still unknown about how magic works, or even how it came to be. You push the boundaries of what is possible in ways that few can conceptualize.

There are a few stories from the time when magic was gifted to humanity that speak of free passage between the realm of mortals and that of the gods. And tucked away in a little grotto somewhere, guarded by a chimeric beast, is a spring. From that spring bubbles an ambrosia of immortality. The story goes that the Gods bathed in this liquid, granting them their status out of time. If a human were to partake of that ambrosia either by bathing or imbibing, time would stop for them as well, and they would be as a God among men or an equal among the Gods. But no mortal was ever able to best the guardian, and in the time since, the Gods have severed all physical connections between their world and \pEarth{}.

All other scholars believe therefore that the possibility of immortality is lost to humanity. You, however, know better. To achieve this, there are three things which must be accomplished, all of which are possible. One, you must acquire a weapon against the beast. Two, you must build a path to reach the realm of the Gods.  And three, you must have some way of remaining corporeal in that Realm so that you can carry the weapon.

The first is easy enough. The \iScythe{} is one of the \pFarm{} Relics that can be used for the Ritual to control the Storm. Here on the island, so close to the building storm, the Relics absorb power and become highly charged with it. The \iScythe{} in such a state could be used to kill someone without risking retribution from the Gods. It could also be used to kill almost any \textbf{thing} - like the guardian of the fountain. If the \iScythe{} is used in the ritual, though, it’s power will be drained. Therefore, you must ensure that the \iPitcher{} is used in the ritual instead.

The third took a lot of digging (some of it literal), but you have a solution. Most records of the \cDisneySect{} were burned, not long after they were. The \cDisneySect{} were a small cult of \cFarmGod{} clerics who were researching some exceedingly esoteric things, including something akin to astral projection, but in reverse. Unfortunately for you, the sect was destroyed in a decisive strike by the mainstream church some 200 years ago and their knowledge almost lost. Over painstaking years, you pieced together the story of a person in a glass box, under an enchanted sleep. A living repository, if only \cDisney{\they} could be found and awoken. Once you found \cDisney{\them} under the very roots of the \pSpine{}, it was simple enough to break the spell. It was a good curse, but an old one that had never been renewed. It took barely a brush of your power to unravel it.

Nine months ago, you woke \cDisney{} from \cDisney{\their} magical slumber. \cDisney{\They} \cDisney{\were} quite disoriented in this new world, and you have been serving as a mentor and supporter. It was your influence that got \cDisney{} a place at the \pSchool{}. \cDisney{\They} \cDisney{\are} a sweet \cDisney{\child}, and interacting with \cDisney{\them} sets your teeth on edge. Still, you must continue the charade of a generous benefactor for now. You must gain \cDisney{\their} trust and persuade \cDisney{\them} to share with you the secrets of the \cDisneySect{}, and the ritual that would allow you to have a physical form on the astral plane, where-in lies the realm of the Gods.

The second part of your plan is the most uncertain. The Gods themselves supposedly severed the connections between their world and yours. Forging a new path will be difficult. But here at the \pSc{} are some of the best minds in all of \pEarth{} -- and you have reason to suspect that the answer might be closer to home than you could ever have imagined. \cCurse{} is about as powerful as a \emph{commoner} can get, and while you are loath to interact with \cCurse{\them} more than you must, if \cCurse{\they} \cCurse{\have} the key to reaching the realm of the Gods, then interact you must.

If people knew your real agenda, they would probably call you selfish, but your interest in the Gods goes back to long before you realized that Immortality was in your grasp. People tend to talk about the four patron Gods like they are the only gods -- but they are not. There are \textbf{many} minor Gods, of all kinds of things. One throws salt over one’s shoulder to invoke a minor God of protection and so forth. And the hierarchy of the Gods is not as cemented as they would like mortals to believe. The Gods are \textbf{always} jockeying for position. And people like you know the signs to read. Something is happening in the realm of the Gods. A new God - a fifth God - is preparing something big. But you don’t know what. Or who. Or why. You’ve been seeking out this new God’s followers for several years now, to no avail. But something is coming to a head this weekend and you want to know what. Maybe you’ll get lucky and these people will have some alternate way to reach the realm of the Gods.

Still, you’ve been searching for several years to no avail, so maybe you need a different approach. \cDisney{} has always been good at getting into places \cDisney{they} \cDisney{\does}n’t belong. You’ve asked \cDisney{\them} to help you get into \cBunker{}’s suitcase in particular. \cBunker{} is entirely too well informed to be \emph{just} an engineer. \cBunker{They} must know something. If whatever \cBunker{\they} know\cBunker{\plural} isn’t the something you want, you could always turn to the \pTech{}. \cHeadScientist{} and \cAssistantScientist{} are among the foremost talents in their country. Surely they will be able to devise a way for you to search for information about this fifth God.

But pet projects aside for a minute, technically you \textbf{are} here as an advisor. Your job is to support \cEvil{} at the bargaining table and try to get a ceasefire, or something. Frankly, you’d rather the peace talks failed and the war continue. The war benefits you. Your family holds lands that border the \pTech{}, and the importation of weapons and exportation of food fills your coffers. And for you personally, the war distracts the Gods, meaning no one is looking too closely at what you are doing. For surely the Gods would stop you if they knew you were after something as divine as immortality. The morality of indirectly hurting or killing the idiots that started the war (the \pShip{}) doesn’t particularly concern you.

An advisor must always be apprised of the current political situation, and in the viper's nest of Court in the \pFarm{}, a single wrong phrase could end a career. This means you are fully aware of the fact that \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{} favors \cQueen{\their} \textbf{youngest} \cPrince{\child}, \cPrince{} as \cQueen{\their} heir. Now your family has never fallen over themselves to fawn at the \cQueen{\Majesty}’s feet, and one of the \cQueen{\Majesty}’s other children might be a softer touch (leaving more power for your family to amass), but \cPrince{} might also prove to be a valuable ally. Either way, something was supposed to happen a month ago. \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{} sent \cPrince{} to visit Duke \cChupStudent{\formal}. You held your breath to see where the chips would fall. None fell. Something went wrong. For the idle curiosity of one whose life could soon depend on it, you’d dearly love to know what.

This weekend the goal of Immortality, something you’ve worked toward for many years, is within your grasp. Shake hands with him, charm her, and it’ll be yours. You just gotta make sure whatever the new God has planned isn’t going to screw with \emph{your} plans, and survive whatever political machinations are afoot. But you intend to keep an open mind, either of these uncertainties could be an advantage for you to capitalize on.


\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Partake of the ambrosia of the Gods. To do this, you will need:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To convince \cDisney{} to teach you the ritual to be able to be corporeal on the astral plane, and then perform that ritual.
		\item Find a way to reach the realm of the Gods. Maybe \cCurse{} can help?
		\item Bring the super-charged \iScythe{} with you to slay the guardian.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Figure out what this new God is planning. Their followers on \pEarth{} are probably your best lead. You just have to find them. Having \cDisney{} raid \cBunker{}’s stuff, and talking to \cHeadScientist{} and \cAssistantScientist{} might also yield results.
	\item Decide where you stand with \cPrince{} and support or hinder \cPrince{\them} as you deem appropriate.
	\item Prevent a peace treaty or ceasefire from being reached.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item <NEEDS NOTE FOR THE RN>
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cDisney{}} An 18 year old \cDisney{\child} you awoke from a magical slumber. \cDisney{\They} \cDisney{\have} a secret you need, so you are playing nice.
	\contact{\cEvil{}} The head of the \pFarm{} delegation; you are supposed to be \cEvil{\their} second at the negotiating table, but you expect to be quite busy with your other plans.
	\contact{\cCurse{}} A \emph{commoner}, but one who may have a way to reach the Realm of the Gods.
	\contact{\cPrince{}} The youngest \cPrince{\child} of \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{}. \cPrince{} has designs on the throne and you haven’t made your mind up yet whether you support \cPrince{\their} bid.
