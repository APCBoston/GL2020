\name{\cAdopted{}}

You are \cAdopted{} (\cAdopted{\they}/\cAdopted{\them}), and 19 years old. You are a First Year student at \pSchool{}, and you grew up in \pFarm{}, but your family life is\ldots complicated.  You yearn to undo the despicable norms in your country that led to your kidnapping by the Nobility who could supposedly provide better for you than those who truly love you, and you'll do anything to find your true family.  You are determined to punish the ones who took you, and use the great magical potential that you were born with to better the lives of the farming families across \pFarm{} whether the \cQueen{\Majesty} and the Nobility like it or not.

You were born into a poor family that farmed the lands under the rule of \cAdoptedParentOne{}, but when your magical potential was discovered you were promptly ``adopted'' into the Noble family.  Your new so-called family told you it was for your own best interest, and that they could give you a life and education that your birth family could never provide.  In reality, you never felt truly included, and you hate the people who kept you from your true family, and you've got plans for revenge.

The magically inclined members of your ``adopted'' family specialize in charms of protection, primarily illusions of the highest quality that make one thing look like another. Willingly or not, you learned the family trade, and are adept both at creating such charms, and spotting them on objects. Breaking such enchantments is something you are still practicing.

You were a child when the Storm struck \pFarm{}, devastating your region and killing a number of people.  You still have nightmares that never fail to leave you shaken and feeling helpless.  As a student at the \pSchool{}, it now falls upon you and your fellow magically powerful students to direct the terrifying Storms, Luckily, the \pSchool{} has bunkers to protect the students, and as long as they're in good working order\ldots are they?  Who would know?  Oh Gods, what if they aren't??  No, surely there are people on top of their maintenance\ldots Yes, of course everything will be fine.  You'll be fine\ldots But maybe you should go check just in case?

After so many years apart from your birth family, you long to reconnect. You know that \cAdoptedParentOne{} would never approve, and the family would conspire to prevent you from doing so. So you have a need for secrecy. You have heard rumors of these things called ``vid-com'' devices in the \pTech{}. These devices are not yet available to the general public, but allow for communication between two people who each hold one of these devices. If only you could get your hands on a pair, you could keep one for yourself, and give one to your birth family. Let's leave aside for the moment the fact that you'll have to \emph{find} your birth family to give them one of these devices.

Finding such items when they aren't generally available will be tricky. You'll probably have to find a way to access the black market. And then there's the matter of money. While you aren't exactly hurting for pocket money, you suspect that the black market is likely to trade on things other than \pFarm{} currency. You are more than prepared to break rules or take on personal sacrifice to make this happen.

Beyond the immediate goals of finding and communicating with your birth family, you feel driven to improve the lives of your family and all those like them, who are so often ignored, neglected, or abused by the Nobility.  Healing magic, which comes in the form of enchanted music, is provided only by the Priesthood, and then only with the approval of whatever capricious Noble deems the recipient worthy.  If only you could devise a way to record the healing music, and get it into the hands of the farmers who truly need it, you could improve the lives of so many.  You won't let the fact that these ideas are seditious stop you.

Of course, to hold on to any advances you make, you'll need to start building your own base of authority, outside of your ``adopted'' family. Many of the most powerful and successful people in the \pFarm{} are alumni of the \pSchool{}. Having the most votes among the \pFarmers{} students would indicate that you have the favor of the teachers, the advisors, and \cFarmGod{}. You'd be well on your way to carving out a place for yourself in \pFarm{} society, from which you could implement all kinds of improvements. Which is to say nothing of how much peace of mind it would give you to be able to direct the storm away from your home. You don't want any other child to have to go through the fear and terror you did.

What was otherwise shaping up to be a quiet end to the year has gotten more complicated thanks to your friends \cDisney{} and \cPirateChild{}. They approached you a few weeks ago with somewhat of a dilemma. The two of them had gotten ahold of a sea serpent egg and decided to keep it and hatch it! You can't leave those two alone for 5 seconds before they do something ridiculous. To keep them from getting in trouble, you agreed to use your magic to disguise the sea serpent egg as a rock. But now it's hatched. Casting illusions on living things is -much- harder. The illusions don't last nearly as long, and anything the creature does will be modeled in the image. How would you explain a stuffed animal that begs for table scraps?

All in all, despite the various obstacles and troubles, you’re hopeful that you’ll be able to make meaningful connections with your real family, improve their lives with healing magic, and punish those who have wronged you.  All you’ve got to do is survive the storm, and not get kicked out for hiding a sea serpent.
