%% This file sets up the Sign and Label datatypes and creates Sign and
%% Label macros.
%%
%% Signs generally represent interesting parts of game area, usually
%% as things posted on walls.  Labels represent other things, often on
%% or inside envelopes, that are part of complex mechanics.
%%
%% The default value for \MYloc will inherit location from the Place
%% or Sign most immediately up the ownership tree.  Override this by
%% setting \MYloc to anything (even blank).
%%
%% Sign is for full-sized signs that would cover most of a large
%% manila envelope; SignMedium is for signs sized to half-sized manila
%% envelopes; SignSmall is for signs sized for small manila envelopes
%% (the same size as item cards).  Label, LabelMedium, and LabelSmall
%% are analagous, but they don't have a \takedownby note at the
%% bottom.  You can always use a sign or label without an envelope or
%% with a differently-sized envelope.  Choose which based on
%% visibility and content.
%%
%% SignTiny is for signs you want to be hard to find; it is small and
%% does not have a \takedownby note.  SignDot is for a very small
%% "dot" which only has a title.
%%
%% SignStrip produces a strip of paper (without a \takedownby note)
%% with labels on the outside that show on both sides if you fold it
%% in half.  These are a convenient alternative to sub-envelopes. They
%% can also be used for "s-packets" taped to walls (see
%% Extras/README-s-packets).
%%
%% LabelCover produces a label similar to the cover to a research
%% notebook.  LabelPage, likewise, produces a page.
%%
%% EOG is for full-sized end-of-game signs.

  \emph{You see \iMirror{} in your mind. In it, you see your reflection. The mirror drifts close enough to you for your breath to fog the surface. Instead of fading, the mist begins to swirl slowly across the darkening surface of the mirror. You feel compelled to touch it. And in doing so, you fall forward into the mirror, tumbling into the vortex. Back through the swirling mist of time you are drawn.}

\emph{You find yourself in a fancy restaurant in \pTech{}. Two figures are speaking quietly in a corner booth. \cEvil{} says ``I can buy you more time to figure out how to stop the storms. But you must do something for me in return'' \cHeadScientist{} nods eagerly, and the scene fades as \cEvil{} passes \cHeadScientist{} a small satchel.}

\emph{A flash of \cEvil{} handing a small bottle to someone dressed as a \pSchool{} employee, on the edge of the Lake beneath the \pSc{}. \cEvil{} says ``make sure only the students drink the wine. More bodies than that and people might find their way back to me.'' The person nods.}

My agent already has the fake stones.'' \cDiplomat{} replies ``Good, now make sure you clean up any loose ends.'' The grin \cEvil{} has as the scene fades sends chills down your spine.}

\emph{The \pSchool{}, the Ritual to Control the Storm just completed. The students stand or sit, panting. One student is clearly a \cHeir{\formal}. Another looks very much like \cAssistantScientist{} might have looked 6 years ago.  The Teachers and Advisors rush in from the edges of the room to support the students. Somehow in the chaos glasses of wine are produced. A toast is proposed. All of the students drink, except \cAssistantScientist{}’s lookalike. \cAssistantScientist{\They} sniff the glass, make a dubious face, and put it down. As \cAssistantScientist{\their} classmates start to collapse, \cAssistantScientist{\they} slip out a side door, unnoticed.

The Dream reverberates with magic, and you know it to be the truth - it may not be the `textbf{whole} truth, but everything you saw happened. When you speak of what the dream showed you, if you speak truly, your voice will ring with the same magic, carrying the weight of truth to convince your listeners. \emph{(OOC: You should tell other players that your voice carries the weight of magical truth when you speak of what you’ve seen. Keep in mind however that a character may choose to pretend not to believe you for any number of reasons.}

If one or more \iStoneFlower{\MYname} (\iStoneFlower{\MYnumber}) were substituted in the ritual for other flowers, you also have a pounding headache for the next 30 minutes or so.}

Something always seems to be in bloom, and those versed in the subtle language of flowers can tell the time of year, even the time of day, by what is blooming. A lovely place for a stroll, a secret rendezvous, or simply to meditate in solitude. To explore the gardens and see what is blooming, spend one uninterrupted minute in front of this sign without taking any other actions (conversation is fine), then you may look through all of the items in the appropriate envelope, depending on the time of day. You may then either put the item back for others to enjoy, or pick \textbf{one} flower (against College policy) and keep the item.}

Nonetheless, more than a few important figures from the College’s history, and that of the world as a whole, are buried here. The imposing, wrought iron gates are flanked by bronze statues of the avatars of the Gods - a scarab beetle, a sea serpent, and a giant hummingbird. Both statues and gates are badly corroded, perhaps due to the fog which seems to perpetually cover this place. Grand mausoleums and humble tombstones alike lie shrouded ahead, their dim silhouettes like ghosts in the mist. Walk among the graves if you dare, and see what the dead can teach.}

\emph{Here rests Katharina Friedrich, First Principal of the College of the Gods from the year 0 PF to 181 PF.}

Carved into the stone, a spiral staircase winds round its flanks before reaching the summit. It is here that students at the College of the Gods are trained in the art of magical combat and self defense. The Circle has seen everything from friendly sparring to grueling combat drills and winner-take-all duels; the College prides itself on the fact that no one has ever died within its bounds. The Circle’s pockmarked surface is covered with glowing magical sigils, powering the energy fields which prevent anyone swept from the summit from falling to their death.}
