\name{\cEthics{}}

You are \cEthics{\full} (\cEthics{\they}/\cEthics{\them}), 46 years old, and a teacher at the \pSchool{}. You teach Ethics and Morality, which is quite the load to bear right now, given how unethically so many powerful people on \pEarth{} are behaving. You've found yourself bending more and more rules to stay true to your moral compass, and you only hope you can hold it together through this weekend -- with a possible end to a senseless war, now is no time to fall apart.

You grew up in the \pTech{}. Your family lived in a poor neighborhood, but scraped together enough money to send you and your younger sibling to good schools. The merit scholarships you collected along the way certainly didn't hurt. Even from a young age, the disparities were obvious between your family and others from your school. It was enough to keep you up at night, thinking about what made someone \emph{good}. For years you thought, wrote, debated, and advocated for change in the \pTech{}. After getting fed up with your well marshaled arguments falling on the deaf ears of the Council, you decided to turn to teaching instead.

You started teaching at the \pSc{} 20 years ago; your career as an activist and writer helped land you the coveted position at such a young age. Two years later, you were approached by one of the advisors from the \pFarm{}. \cEvil{\They} indicated a need for utmost secrecy to help save a life. Once you understood the situation -- someone was hunting \cEvil{\full}'s family for political gains -- you agreed to take \cEvil{\their} baby \cPirateChild{\kid} and hide \cPirateChild{\them}. You reached out to \cPirate{\full}, a teacher brand new to the school at the time, and a person you'd grown to be fast friends with. \cPirate{\They} still had a lot of connections in the \pShip{}, where yours from the \pTech{} had already started to atrophy. \cPirate{} agreed to take the \cPirateChild{\kid} and find \cPirateChild{\them} a good home. It hurt your heart to just send the \cPirateChild{\kid} off to an unknown fate, but there was nothing for it -- the best way to keep the \cPirateChild{\kid} safe was to hide \cPirateChild{\them} as well as possible. 

In honor of that wayward child, you do your best to shelter and support every student that comes to the school. You are firm with your boundaries, but are as kind and understanding as possible. You relish helping students work through their moral quandaries and have become somewhat of a popular person to ask for advice. You try to instill in each of your students the idea that ethics should be subservient to morality and that tradition is no reason to withhold justice. Among the current crop of students, you find \cAmbition{\full} particularly promising. \cAmbition{\They} \cAmbition{\have} the will and the drive to make change, if you could just point \cAmbition{\them} in the right direction. You intend to help \cAmbition{\them} by convincing the \pShip{} teachers and the \pTech{} advisors to rank \cAmbition{\them} the highest for voting authority to direct the Storm — that is, if you can ensure \cAmbition{\theyare} willing to send the Storm somewhere other than the \pShip{}.

Indeed, the first big test of morality your students face is the vote to direct the Storm. You thought you were doing pretty well with the students six years ago -- but when the votes were revealed, and the \pShip{} betrayed, you were horrified. And then to lose every one of them to an unsolved murder? You had your hands full in the immediate aftermath, working closely with \cFlowPriest{\full} to provide emotional support for everyone. Many of your colleagues ended up resigning after that. You nearly quit yourself out of depression at your own failure. But no. You had to stand firm. You had to stay, and try harder for the next group. While you loathe whoever orchestrated this betrayal, your primary concern right now is to help your current students find the light -- and you have the strong hope that the student's this year could be made of stern enough stuff to right the wrong wrought six years ago. If the students refuse to support the ongoing treaty between the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}, the advisors may be persuaded to make reparations to the \pShip{} and re-establish some form of the original treaty that governed the Storm. You just have to convince the students to take that stand without being accused of orchestrating it yourself.

But even if the Storm is directed away from the \pShip{} this year, there is still the war to consider. To that end, you have begun engaging with one of your \pShip{} students, \cWarlordDaughter{\full}, who happens to be the Warlord's \cWarlordDaughter{\child}. \cWarlordDaughter{\They} seem\cWarlordDaughter{\plural} to really enjoy your class, which makes a great starting point for conversation. \cWarlordDaughter{} is key to ending the war, in your opinion. There are critical treaty negotiations going on this weekend that have the potential to end the war. But even if the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} are ready to discuss reparations for the \pShippies{}, the \pShip{} must also be willing to come to the negotiating table. Your best chance for insight into the warlike \cLoud{\full} is \cLoud{\their} \cWarlordDaughter{\child}, \cWarlordDaughter{}. What information you can find on Black Crow ship suggests that \cLoud{} was quite the calm and patient co-captain with their partner \cQuiet{\full}. You suspect something must have happened to shift \cLoud{\their} personality so drastically, and hope that if it can somehow be reversed, the \pShip{} may be willing to negotiate a truce.

But as long as the war is still on, you intend to at least do what you can to alleviate the suffering it causes. In pursuit of this, some years back you stumbled backwards into the black market. You never meant to get so involved in illegal activity, but when all the legal avenues are blocked, it is a moral obligation to use an illegal one to make necessary change. You originally got involved dealing information, feeding bits and pieces into the \pShip{} spy network, in hopes of giving the \pShippies{} the upper hand in the war for long enough that the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} would agree to a ceasefire, and ultimately a just treaty that makes up for the wrongs done these past six years. Now you are involved in many more things -- helping pass information, technology, and even food to people in desperate need of it. You are pretty sure that you have kept your involvement a secret so far, since you have been using \cLibrarian{\full}'s assistant, \cLibAssist{\full}, to pass information back and forth between you and the black market. \cLibAssist{}'s continued participation tells you that \cLibAssist{\theyare} probably making \cLibAssist{\their} own deals too.

You were contacted anonymously a few months back by someone in the \pShip{} spy network, who gave you a way to occasionally pass them information directly, rather than going through the black market. This was a welcome change, as you were increasingly troubled by the shifty nature of the market and what else they might be dealing in. They have an agent here this weekend among the \pShip{} advisors whom you can pass information and items to. That agent is none other than the engineer charged with maintaining the Bunkers, \cBunker{\full}. You are nervous about making direct contact with a \pShip{} spy, but it will certainly speed up communications. One important piece of information you stumbled upon and are considering giving to the \pShip{} is that \cHistory{\full} is far more than just a history teacher –  \cHistory{\theyare} also the personal spymaster of the \cQueen{\Majesty} of the \pFarm{}! You have moral qualms about sharing this, though, as  \cHistory{} is a friend, colleague, and excellent teacher, and the information could completely ruin \cHistory{\their} career, and maybe even jeopardize \cHistory{\their} safety. But if it turns out to be the key to ending the war, you're morally obligated to share it\ldots{} aren't you? It is tough to care so deeply about what is right. Normally, you would seek advice from your friend and mentor at the school, Principal \cPrincipal{\full}, but in this case that is out of the question. \cPrincipal{} is the first one \cHistory{} would be in trouble with.

Ethics is a lonely discipline. You've been searching for romantic companionship for a long time, and just haven't found the right person. But recently it occurred to you that the answer might be right under your nose. You've been speaking with the Religion teacher, \cBeetle{\full}, quite a bit recently, and found \cBeetle{\them} to be thoughtful, intelligent, and possessed of a robust moral philosophy. You have found yourself beginning to develop romantic feelings for \cBeetle{\them}. This is a bit complicated by the fact that \cBeetle{} is polyamorous and in an established relationship with \cJuniorStatesman{\full}. Polyamory isn't recognized as a valid relationship structure in the \pTech{}, but you've been exposed to so many new ideas since you began teaching at the \pSchool{}, and you are open to giving it a try. At first, you figured you would simply find the right time to approach \cBeetle{} and talk about your feelings -- but then \cJuniorStatesman{} showed up this morning. \cJuniorStatesman{} is attractive, intelligent, and kind -- and honestly every bit as intriguing, in \cJuniorStatesman{\their} own way. Trying to start two brand new relationships at the same time is intimidating and could get messy, but you think \cJuniorStatesman{} and \cBeetle{} might be worth it. Regardless of what you decide, the three of you will have a lot to talk about. Since \cJuniorStatesman{} is only here for the weekend, and it'll be who knows how long until \cJuniorStatesman{\theyare} next here, you've really only got this weekend to broach the subject.

This weekend, there is a war to end, and countless injustices to set on a path to healing. As one of the school's most beloved teachers, you have the ability to influence the students to make the right choice, and advocate for an end to the war. You have espionage work to do and hard choices to make about which secrets to share. And on a more personal note, you need to figure out what you are going to do about your feelings for \cJuniorStatesman{} and \cBeetle{}.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Convince the students to send the Storm somewhere other than the \pShip{}, and if it will serve that end, help \cAmbition{} by convincing the \pShip{} teachers and the \pTech{} advisors to rank \cAmbition{\them} the highest for voting authority.
\item Find a way to end the war. The treaty negotiations this weekend are one avenue. To aid those negotiations, you are hoping that you can speak to \cWarlordDaughter{} about how to get \cLoud{} to stop the relentless \pShip{} assault, or at least come to the bargaining table.
	\item Decide how and whether to approach \cBeetle{} and/or \cJuniorStatesman{} about the possibility of starting a polyamorous relationship.
	\item Find information on the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} to feed to the \pShip{} via your spy contact, \cBunker{}. Decide whether to reveal that \cHistory{} is the \cQueen{\Majesty} of the \pFarm{}'s spymaster.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You teach Ethics and Morality at the College of the Gods.
	\item You were present at the school for the Time of Deciding six years ago, but don't know anything beyond the official story. You were too busy providing emotional support to the advisors and your fellow teachers, and trying to cobble together some form of self care, to want to get underfoot with the investigation.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cEvil{}} A \pFarm{} advisor who asked for your help saving a life 18 years ago.
\contact{\cPirate{}} A fellow teacher, from the \pShip{}, to whom you entrusted that life. You grew to be fast friends 18 years ago, and that friendship has endured.
\contact{\cAmbition{}} A \pTech{} student with an incredible drive to amass influence; you've no doubt that if anyone could change the system from the inside, it's \cAmbition{}.
	\contact{\cLibAssist{}} The Librarian's assistant, and your one point of contact with the black market.
	\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} A student from \pShip{}, the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of the Warlord, and, you hope, the key to ending this senseless war.
	\contact{\cHistory{}} The history teacher at the \pSc{}, a friend of yours, and apparently the spymaster of the \cQueen{\Majesty} of the \pFarm{}?!
	\contact{\cBunker{}} The advisor charged with maintaining the Bunkers at the school. Also, as it happens, your \pShip{} spy contact.
	\contact{\cPrincipal{}} The immortal principal of the school, who has mentored you ever since you first arrived twenty years ago. You know it must be lonely to be immortal, watching people come and go, and you're honored by the close bond you share.
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} An attractive \cBeetle{\cleric} from the \pTech{}, and your fellow teacher of many years. \cBeetle{\Theyare} moral, idealistic, and charmingly awkward. You'd very much like to start up a romantic relationship with \cBeetle{\them}.
	\contact{\cJuniorStatesman{}} Attractive, intelligent, kind, and complicatedly enough, \cBeetle{}'s polyamorous, usually long-distance, partner. You'd like to strike up a romantic relationship with \cJuniorStatesman{\them} too.
\end{contacts}
