\name{\cScholarship{}}

You are \cScholarship{\full} (\cScholarship{\they}/\cScholarship{\them}) - 21 years old and very magically talented. As an orphan from \pTech{}, you were only able to attend school, and now be here at the \pSchool{} on a religious scholarship granted to you by your mentor, \cAntiChup{\full}, and because of that your position here is distressingly precarious.

You never knew your parents. Instead, your first memories are from the orphanage. It wasn't bad as such, but neither was it a home. Your interest in religion initially spawned from the comfort that your spirituality brought you when times were hard. When the Church agreed to take you in full time as a teenager, you were overjoyed. Unfortunately, that joy was short lived, and faded shortly after \cAntiChup{} came into your life. After taking an interest in you thanks to your religious devotion and strong magical potential, \cAntiChup{} took charge of every aspect of your upbringing, curating your education and eventually starting to use you as an errand runner. Over the course of several years, the errands became more difficult, important, and dangerous - but none took you far from \cAntiChup{}'s watchful eye for long.

You hoped things would change once you reached the \pSchool{}. \cAntiChup{} had been wildly supportive of your desire to attend the \pSc{}, and at first you were so happy for \cAntiChup{\their} support, but the motive behind it soon became clear - \cAntiChup{\they} wanted an agent on the inside. And with \cAntiChup{} in charge of the scholarship that allows you to attend, your position is contingent on continuing to please \cAntiChup{\them}. Still, at the \pSchool{} you got your first taste of something that resembled freedom, as well as the friendship of your frequent study partner, \cTechStar{\full}, and you want \emph{more} of it. \cTechStar{} is a dreamer like no other, and you love to listen as \cTechStar{\they} wax\cTechStar{\pluralC} poetic about the ways \cTechStar{\they} want\cTechStar{\plural} to change the \pTech{} for the better. \cAntiChup{} has grand plans for your future, and you like the general direction planned for you, but you're not perhaps as \emph{grateful}, or as blindly devoted, as you've been given the impression that you should be.

\cAntiChup{} is always plotting and tasking you with carrying out those plots. Under \cAntiChup{}'s direction, you ``borrowed'' the \iScythe{} from the \pSc{} library, and on a recent school break you hunted down the Avatar of \cEbbFull{}, one of the two \pShip{} Avatars, and killed it. The action has theoretically given the \pTech{} the upper hand in the war by eliminating the connection between the \pShip{} and their Goddesses, but it also broke the connection between the \iScythe{} and the \pFarm{}. You managed to sneak the \iScythe{} back into the library, but it needs to be re-attuned to \pFarm{} before anyone finds out and traces the crime back to you. To do that, you'll need to make sure the ritual to renew the leylines happens as soon as possible, as it is a prerequisite. The principal, \cPrincipal{\full} is traditionally the one in charge of that ritual. 

While assassinating a God's Avatar was the most traumatic, this is hardly the first crime \cAntiChup{} has forced you to commit, and that pattern is exactly why you don't intend to answer to \cAntiChup{} forever. In fact, you have plans to end that this very weekend. The sticking point is the ``\iScholarship{},'' which is currently made out in \cAntiChup{}'s name. You need to find a way to convince \cAntiChup{} to sign it over to another member of the Church of Kero. You know and like \cBeetle{\full}, the religion teacher at the \pSc{}. Alas \cBeetle{\they} \cBeetle{\does}n't seem to like you very much. \cBeetle{} is of course a \cBeetle{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}; they wouldn't be able to take on your scholarship otherwise. Being the only other Cleric of \cTechGod{} here, \cBeetle{\theyare} kind of your only option right now. If another opportunity presents itself, though, you'll take whatever you can get – short of emigrating. You love the \pTech{} and have no interest in moving to a different country. Of course, you will have to convince \cBeetle{} to become your new patron. You plan to accomplish that by convincing \cEbbPriest{\full} to let you help with \cEbbPriest{\their} research on the Creation of \pEarth{}. The Creation is a hotly contested topic among religious scholars across \pEarth{}, and \cBeetle{} is a premier scholar. Discovering something previously unknown about the beginning will surely impress \cBeetle{\them}. You also hope that helping with the ritual to renew the leylines will ingratiate you to \cBeetle{}. You will have an uphill battle, as \cBeetle{\they} \cBeetle{\does}n't like \cAntiChup{} (sarcasm: you can't imagine why!) and seems to have painted you with the same brush. Convincing \cBeetle{\them} that you are different will be challenging but crucial.

At the moment, the primary task \cAntiChup{} has assigned you is to assist with some half-baked scheme to gain more spies among the \pShip{}, in coordination with \cPrince{\full} of the \pFarm{}. This involves brewing a Curse that will allow \cAntiChup{} to see through the target's eyes and hear through their ears without them ever being the wiser. As usual, the most dangerous task has been given to you – planting a tag on the target so that the Curse can be attuned to them. \cAntiChup{} has identified two potential targets, \cInitiate{\full} and \cPirate{\full}. Everyone knows \cInitiate{} is training to become a \cInitiate{\cleric}, but \cAntiChup{} claims to have some secret intel that \cPirate{} is too. Surely \cPirate{\theyare} too old? But \cAntiChup{} is convinced. Since you will only be able to Curse one of them, you have also been tasked with finding blackmail on the other in order to force them to become a spy as well. You are so sick of doing \cAntiChup{} dirty work, but you know that taking on this one last task will make \cAntiChup{} significantly more likely to sign over the ``\iScholarship{}'' -- at least, if you bargain right.

As a secondary assignment, \cAntiChup{} apparently thinks so little of the duties of an advisor, particularly as they pertain to the peace talks happening this weekend, that \cAntiChup{\they} \cAntiChup{\have} delegated them to you. You are supposed to sit at the table with all of the most prestigious delegates from all three nations and represent \cAntiChup{}, the Church, and the \pTech{}. Talk about weight on your shoulders! Still, you worry that if you don't at least try, some agreement will be made that will lead to immense suffering of the \pTech{}. Your people aren't remotely prepared to receive the Storm this year. How many would die if it were to be unleashed upon them? You cannot sit idly by and allow that to happen – you must try to protect your people, no matter how small you feel sitting at that table. At least there will be one seasoned diplomat from the \pTech{} sitting beside you, \cDiplomat{}.

Besides \cAntiChup{}'s plans for the weekend, you have plans of your own too, thank you very much! You know that voting authority for where to direct the storm involves approval from the advisors (which you are sure \cAntiChup{} can arrange,) from the teachers, and from the Gods themselves. Your piety is unmatched by your fellow students and comes naturally to you, so you aren't worried about that. Having the most votes toward where to direct the storm will be a solid first step toward building your own power, so you plan to see that the teachers are on your side. Unfortunately the \pTech{} teachers do not rank the \pTech{} students. This convoluted system is supposed to help prevent favoritism (eyeroll; it jsut makes everything needlessly more complicated.) You will need to convince the \pShippie{} teachers to rank you highest among the \pTech{} students.

As it turns out, you are not the only one at the school trying to escape a toxic guardianship. You've been connecting recently with one of your classmates, \cAdopted{\full}, who was kidnapped from \cAdopted{\their} birth family in the \pFarm{} because of \cAdopted{\their} magical talent and raised by a noble family that treats \cAdopted{\them} badly. Apparently, this is standard practice in that nation, but it seems wrong to you. You find yourself deeply empathizing with \cAdopted{\their} plight, and recognize a fellow good person caught in a bad situation, determined to escape from it by any means necessary. It dawned on you just the other day that your feelings go beyond compassion and respect — you are developing romantic feelings for \cAdopted{\them} too. You haven't told  \cAdopted{} yet and are still deciding what you want to do, but a part of you is desperate to find out if \cAdopted{\they} return your feelings.

If everything goes well, by the end of this weekend, you will be free of \cAntiChup{}'s control, and well on your way to establishing your own power base in the Church. If you can keep your reputation from being tarnished by the revelation of your part in the death of \cEbb{}'s Avatar, so much the better. The \pSchool{} has finally given you a taste of what it means to be your own person and you intend to solidify that here and now.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Convince another member of the \pTech{} clergy, presumably \cBeetle{}, to take over your scholarship.
	\item Re-attune the \iScythe{} before anyone discovers what you did. The ritual to renew the leylines must be completed in order to do this.
	\item Earn as much voting authority for directing the Storm as you can, and make sure the Storm does not get sent to the \pTech{}.
	\item Find blackmail on \cInitiate{} and/or \cPirate{} and help create the Curse to use on one of them in order to stay in \cAntiChup{}'s good graces.
	\item Decide what to do about your romantic feelings for \cAdopted{}, and see if there is some way you can help \cAdopted{\them} escape \cAdopted{\their} toxic, adoptive family.
	\item Sit in on the peace negotiations as \cAntiChup{}'s representative, and advocate for the \pTech{} as best you can.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are in your second of three years at the \pSchool{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cAntiChup{}} Your shady mentor and sort-of foster \cAntiChup{\parent}. You owe \cAntiChup{\them} a lot, and you care for \cAntiChup{\them}, but you need to be your own person. And hopefully be forced to commit fewer crimes.
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} Another member of the \pTech{} clergy. You hope to convince \cBeetle{\them} to take over sponsoring your scholarship.
\contact{\cTechStar{}} A friend you often study with, who you feel like you can rely on.
 	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} The veteran \pTech{} diplomat leading the peace negotiations. \cDiplomat{\They} \cDiplomat{\does}n't know you, but you expect to be working with \cDiplomat{\them} a lot since \cAntiChup{} has delegated \cAntiChup{\their} role in the negotiations to you.
\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} A \pShip{} \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{} who is studying The Creation of \pEarth{}. You hope to get in on \cEbbPriest{\their} research in order to impress \cBeetle{}.
 	\contact{\cAdopted{}} A student from the \pFarm{} whom you have been connecting with over both wanting to escape toxic guardianships. You also happen to find \cAdopted{\them} incredibly attractive, and wonder if \cAdopted{\they} feel\cAdopted{\plural} the same way about you...
	\contact{\cPirate{}} The Shop and Crafting teacher at the school, and, according to \cAntiChup{}, secretly interested in becoming a \cPirate{\cleric} of Ebb or Flow. One of \cAntiChup{}'s potential targets for becoming an unwitting magical informant.
	\contact{\cInitiate{}} A fellow student at the school, and an initiate of Ebb and Flow. One of \cAntiChup{}'s potential targets for becoming an unwitting magical informant.
	\contact{\cPrince{}} A collaborator in \cAntiChup{}'s bid to turn the potential \pShip{} clerics into informants. You don't know what \cAntiChup{} is giving \cPrince{\them} in return, but the whole thing is super shady.
