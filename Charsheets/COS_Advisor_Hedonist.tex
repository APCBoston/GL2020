\name{\cHedonist{}}

You are \cHedonist{\full} (\cHedonist{\they}/\cHedonist{\them}), and 51 years old. You are a \cHedonist{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{}, and perhaps indulge in the benefits of the position a little more than is strictly proper. Still, you do your duty, and try to do right by your country and the next generation. This weekend is going to be the hardest you've had to work since the last time you were here.

Your place in the Priesthood was assured from a very early age. Your family is quite powerful in the Priesthood (and consequently in the nobility), and your magical prowess manifested very young. This has made life quite easy for you, as you can sail through most challenges. For many things, your natural talent lets you complete most tasks with minimal effort -- and for anything more substantial, a bit of gold or a political favor greases almost any palm. You even dodged any real responsibility by getting your sibling promoted to the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s Court Cleric position instead of yourself.

The only \emph{real} challenge you face is finding things to suit your refined palette. The best food comes from \pFarm{} of course, so that's no problem -- but getting your hands on tech from the \pTech{} and art from the \pShip{} is harder, especially since the war started. Luckily for you, a black market has sprung up to serve the needs of people like you. It's easy enough to trade a few minor curses (they are easy enough to purchase in the \pFarm{}) and tidbits of court gossip in exchange for the latest synth clothing from the \pTech{}. Of course the \pFarm{} spymaster probably wouldn't think it just harmless gossip, but whoever they are, they haven't caught you yet. 

Your most recent acquisition is a particularly nice ring. You bought it about a month ago from your black market contact, \cChupSecond{\full}. It goes splendidly with your azure robes and sapphire chain, and has quickly become one of your most prized possessions. You've been reluctant to show it off publicly, though, since you never know where, or how, the black market acquires its wares, so you do not want to risk the previous owner to see you with it, whoever it may be! For your next purchase, you have your eye on a dry cleaning machine, which will allow you to safely clean your acquired clothes without having to smuggle them back to the \pTech{} (sending them openly would get them confiscated as soon as they crossed the border).

To be clear, it's not that you are opposed to work -- just that you are opposed to \emph{unnecessary} work. And there is a lot of \textbf{necessary} work to be done this weekend. As a \cHedonist{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{}, you have responsibilities. Primarily this entails bringing the \iPitcher{}, one of the \pFarm{} relics for controlling the Storm, and ensuring the Relics are not tampered with. Secondly, it is your responsibility to look after the spiritual wellbeing of the followers of \cFarmGod{}. You are expected to provide counsel and guidance to students and advisors alike, and are charged with initiating anyone desiring to take up \cFarmGod{} as their Patron Deity who demonstrates proper commitment to the faith. Additionally, as a \cHedonist{\cleric} of 
\cFarmGod{}, it is your responsibility to safeguard the sanctity of music and the healing magic that comes with it. The other nations simply do not understand that music is sacred and belongs in the hands of the Priesthood, and you are concerned that the moral fiber of the students from Children of the Sun may be eroded by their heretical ideas. If anyone was free to learn the healing songs, every pirate, malcontent, and political rabble-rouser would seize on the opportunity and quickly destabilize the delicate balance of power in Children of the Sun – unthinkable! You are grateful that at least \cMusic{\full}, the music teacher, is from the \pFarm{}, and seems to hold the proper reverence for music; hopefully \cMusic{\they} \cMusic{\have} been instilling such care and respect in the students.

One of your unofficial duties is to keep an ear out for people asking about the Giant Hummingbirds. The Priesthood has known for some time that fewer and fewer of \cFarmGod{}'s Avatars have been appearing as of late. In the past six years, there have been a distressing \textbf{zero} verified sightings, and only 4 total in the previous decade. If the masses knew, it would incite a panic that \cFarmGod{} had forsaken the country, which is not something a country at war can afford. It would also signal a vulnerability that the \pShippies{} might try to capitalize on, or even cause your \pTechies{} allies to desert you. So far the Priesthood has had no luck determining the cause of the decrease, and your standing orders are to divert anyone attempting such a line of investigation.

As if you didn't have enough priestly duties already, you have also been tasked with keeping an eye on the student \cDisney{\full}, due to rumors that they are a \cDisney{\cleric} of the Aethers, a heretical splinter faction of \cFarmGod{}'s followers. They are said to have attempted a blasphemous ritual to access the Realm of the Gods itself! The details are fuzzy, but that information was dangerous enough that the Church chose to wipe out the faction some 200 years ago; evidently, they didn't quite finish the job. You really hope that \cDisney{} doesn't know the ritual, or if \cDisney{\they} \cDisney{\does}, that \cDisney{\they} \cDisney{\have} the good sense to keep it to \cDisney{\them}self – otherwise, you might have to do something to contain the information.

The other focus of your work this weekend is far less mundane, albeit possibly less crucial? Curse the Deities (quietly, of course) for making the things you must do less interesting than the things you want to do! Six years ago, the \pFarm{} allied themselves with the \pTech{}, and betrayed the \pShip{}. This was done because, by the previous treaty, the Storm should have been sent to the \pTech{} -- but the \pTech{} claimed to be on the verge of discovering a way to rid \pEarth{} of the Storm all together. Three years later, the same excuse was given. But now, the \pTech{} claims to have finally developed a solution. The lead researcher, \cHeadScientist{\full}, and one of \cHeadScientist{\their} assistants, \cAssistantScientist{\full}, are supposed to be presenting the findings this weekend. If it's true, then your countries can come together and implement their solution, and finally be done with the whole thing. The sacrifice of the \pShip{} will have all been worth it. Then, you and the rest of the advisors can get around to talking them down from the ongoing war.

But you've been nearly swindled by knockoffs of fancy things before -- and that makes you inherently suspicious of anything that sounds too good to be true. You have decided to launch your own investigation into the science that \cHeadScientist{} and \cAssistantScientist{} are working on. In pursuit of that, you have found a like mind in \cCurse{\full}, a cursemaker from the \pFarm{}, and the two of you have decided to collaborate. If you can interrogate the scientists under either a Truth-Telling Curse, or if you can manage it, under the power of the Lariat of Truth, that would be the easiest way to establish the veracity of their claims. Doing it in front of other witnesses would be ideal. During or after their presentation on Saturday afternoon seems like the best time for this, since then everyone will have heard for themselves what the scientists are claiming when not compelled to the truth. It is worth thinking about what the consequences would be if the scientists are lying – if the \pTech{} cannot end the Storms, or ending the Storms comes with a cost too high to pay, then what? 

Whatever the answer ends up being, the Storms won't be ending in time for at least this one last Storm. Therefore, you've got a responsibility as an advisor to help determine which students have the most votes to cast toward where to send it. Naturally, you wish to give the most influence to a student who thinks like you. As soon as you figure out what you should think, and how the students feel themselves, you can get right on that. You know that as a loyal member of the Children of the Sun, you are expected to support the alliance with the Free People's Federation and send the Storm to the L'eau. But politics are so...messy. As a venerable advisor and \cHedonist{\cleric}, you think most of the students will listen to you, but if the other advisors start meddling, things could get complicated. 

The students here at the \pSc{}, particularly the twelve who stay this weekend to participate in controlling the Storm, bear a huge responsibility. And when they graduate, they will go on to be movers and shakers in their countries. The teachers shape these minds day in and day out. As an advisor, your one big chance to shape minds is the Advisor's speech at the Ceremony of Excellence. \cMusic{} is in charge of arranging the roster this year, and you intend to have \cMusic{\them} give you the task of giving the advisor's speech. Naturally, there will be other contenders for the honor, but you are prepared to compete -- and win. Your primary competitor is your collaborator \cCurse{}, but what's a little healthy competition between friends?

As much stuff going on as it is, this weekend doesn't need to be \emph{all} work. You have reason to believe the black market moves many goods through agents at the \pSc{}. If you can scope them out and play your cards right, you should be able to get that dry cleaning machine locked up. You should also keep your eyes out for anything else beautiful, useful, or simply interesting that you can acquire. After all, the black market is always full of surprises.

Another diversion will be catching up with your drinking buddy, \cWildCard{\full}. \cWildCard{} came to you as a client to buy some information during a day when you were somewhat drunk and feeling especially playful. \cWildCard{} ended up playing along with your shenanigans until your serious business meeting turned into a night of drinking -- and you've met up plenty of times to drink ever since. It turns out that \cWildCard{} will actually be here this weekend, too! You'd like to find a chance to escape all the stress of being an advisor and just hang out and catch up for a while if you can. 

You also look forward to catching up with an influential friend and sometimes chess partner, \cPrince{\full}, youngest child of \cQueen{\full}, ruler of of the \pFarm{}, and, rumor has it, currently favored to inherit the throne. \cPrince{} doesn't take \cPrince{\them}selves too seriously and \cPrince{\are} a great source of courtly gossip that you can sell on the black market (though you don't tell \cPrince{\them} that). You almost always win the friendly chess games you play together.

People say that compromise is part of life -- but you've never found that to be the case. You've always been able to have your cake and eat it too. This weekend, that means indulging your desire for beautiful, fancy, and exquisite quality goods (regardless of the legality of their acquisition), alongside fulfilling your priestly and advisory duties. It might be a lot to do -- but you've always been able to handle challenges without breaking a sweat. Why should this weekend be any different?

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Fulfill your cleric duties, including protecting the Relics, distracting anyone who asks too many questions about the Giant Hummingbirds, and investigating \cDisney{}'s rumored associations with the heretical cult known as the Aethers.
	\item Get in contact with the black market to acquire a dry cleaning machine and anything else that strikes your fancy; \cChupSecond{} is your current contact. You have curses (purchased from NPCs before coming to the \pSchool{}) and court gossip to sell in exchange.
	\item Work with \cCurse{} to verify the science the \pTech{} is touting to end the Storms once and for all. One means of doing so would be to compel the scientists to speak truthfully with either a Truth-Telling Curse or the Lariat of Truth.
	\item Make sure the Storm does not get sent to the \pFarm{}, and decide which student from your nation to advocate for receiving the most voting authority to ensure this.
	\item Land a role speaking at the Ceremony of Excellence.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item This is your second time at The College of the Gods as an advisor. The first time was three years ago. 
	\item Some potential gossip you could trade on the Black Market (this list is not exhaustive): 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The existence and nature of the Aethers, and the rumor that one of them is here as a student.
		\item Details on the disappearing Giant Hummingbirds, though that getting out would strike a serious blow to the Church, so you are loath to part with it.
		\item \cPrince{} is currently favored to inherit the throne of the \pFarm{} when \cQueen{\their} \cQueen{\Majesty} dies.
		\item Whatever you uncover during game about the veracity of the research into ending the Storms.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemz}
