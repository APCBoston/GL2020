\section{Introduction}
The people of \pShip{} call themselves \pShippies{}. The \pShippies{} are a proud people, with a long history of mercantilism and endless combat against the sea serpents of \pEarth{}. For countless years, they were the caretakers of \pEarth{}'s oceans and cargo. Not everyone in the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} appreciated \pShip{} ways of ``protecting’’ the coast, but nevertheless an equilibrium existed that allowed all three countries to gain mutual benefit.

\section*{Geography}
The \pShip{} are mostly a waterfaring folk. They travel \pEarth{}’s oceans, as far out as the continental shelf extends. (No ship that has ventured out beyond the shelf has returned to tell the tale.) The \pShippies{} also float \pEarth{}’s rivers and lakes, using them as highways for travel, moving goods and people from the other two nations as well as their own.

Most \pShip{} towns cling to the coastline, no matter how rugged. Before the war, it was only on the eastern side of \pEarth{} that the \pShippies{} claimed any land in the interior, and most of it is a massive flood-plain. Around the rest of the continent, the \pShip{} control small stretches of coastline, and almost every island large enough to support a human settlement. 

The only area of ocean that most \pShippies{} fear to sail is \pWod{}. \pWod{} is due west of \pEarth{}, on the border between 8th and 9th fleet. It is an area of unpredictable currents and jagged rock pillars looming out of the ever-present mist. Only the bravest -- or most desperate -- crews will work \pWod{}. Scavenging from the shipwrecks may be profitable, but is also a constant reminder of the dangers of the area.

\subsection*{The Betrayal}
Six years ago, it was \pTech{}'s turn to have the storm directed at them, but the storm was directed at the \pShip{} instead. The damage was tremendous. Unprepared for the storm to hit them, the \pShippies{} were about their regular business. As a result, more than half the fleet was destroyed in the initial 48 hours. 

Reports from \pSchool{} about what happened were frustratingly vague. Despite the consequences of murder in \pEarth{}, somehow the twelve students involved in controlling the storm that year ended up dead. If that wasn't fishy enough, subsequent investigation revealed that the vote was apparently unanimous. The leading theory is not a comforting one. Someone, or some\emph{thing} sabotaged the voting and changed the votes after they had been cast, but before the actual Ritual to control the Storm began.

In other nations, the people can hunker down and wait out the storm. In \pShip{}, that isn’t really possible. Coastal towns can be torn from the cliffside by the massive waves. Ships can be smashed to pieces on the shore. The Storms stir up mud from the bottom that drive fish from their normal patterns and upset the sea serpents. With fishing disrupted, their fleet in tatters, and the sea serpents agitated, the \pShip{} struggled tremendously in the wake of the betrayal.

\section*{Recent History}
Since the betrayal, \pEarth{} has been at war. In a world where murder is punished by the gods with complete and immediate amnesia, only something as dire as the plight of the \pShippies{} could drive a nation to war. Even \cEbbFull{} and \cFlowFull{} have sanctified the war on the \pFarm{} and \pTech{}. Balance must be restored.

The \pShip{} are fighting for their lives. Everyone lost family or friends in the Storm 6 years ago. Nearly every ship clamored for retribution of some kind in the immediate aftermath. \cLoud{\full} enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence on unifying these cries for revenge. \cLoud{\They} championed the proposal to war before the Council of Storm Watchers, and within months, the \pShip{} began raiding the coasts they had previously protected for their neighbors. The war officially began 5 years and 7 months ago. 

At first, the \pShippies{} turned to the pirates for support -- but when they proved wholly uncooperative they instead turned to their natural enemies, the sea serpents. The massive creatures spend most of their lives in the water, but can be driven into the shallows, or even onto the shore, for short periods of time. Once there, the creatures ravage anyone and anything they can reach. Most of the \pShip{} offensive involves luring sea serpents into the shallows, harassing them until they are good and angry, and then driving them onto land belonging to the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}. This way, no human raises a hand against another, and so, no one’s memories are lost.

What began as a campaign of causing destruction has changed somewhat in the intervening years. Especially once the second Storm hit, it became apparent that the \pShip{} needed more territory on the continent proper. \pShippies{} have started fielding landing parties that would go with the serpents, then drive them further inland than could be done from boats. After the carnage, the landing party could then go back and stake claim on the land left abandoned in its wake. Bit by bit, the \pShip{} have been encroaching on land of both of the other nations, although more successfully on the \pFarm{}.

\section*{Internal Politics and International Relations}
Before the betrayal, most of \pShip{} were on reasonable terms with both the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}. The \pShippies{} were available for hire to transport goods, or to chase off sea serpents. Different ships would charge different rates (some quite exorbitant), and if a section of the coast couldn’t pay, then the \pShip{} couldn’t be bothered to protect it. While eventually another ship would come along that was willing to protect the coast for a lower sum, the coast would be in danger until that occurred.

\subsection{Pirates}
``Pirate Ships’’ are a particular subset of \pShip{} ships. Pirates never bothered with the song and dance of offering to protect a coast area. They would just show up and take things. Unlike most people in \pEarth{}, the pirate crews didn’t seem particularly deterred by the risk of losing their memories, and every such crew soon found a contingent of people who would kill, take the consequences, and start again. Since no one was willing to tangle with such reckless people, the pirates were always able to take what they wanted. 

At first the \pShip{} turned a blind eye, allowing pirate ships to congregate en masse in the poorest fleets, the 8th and 9th. But soon enough, pirate ships turned on other \pShippie{} vessels, and began to attack them as well, and have become a genuine problem for everyone.

When the war effort first got underway, it was expected that the pirates would fall in line with the national strategy and stop preying on \pShippie{} vessels, at least for a while. After all, with very few safe harbors in the 8th and 9th fleets, Storms are more devastating to pirates on average than the rest of the \pShip{}. But that has not been the case -- if anything, the pirates have stepped up their attacks on their distracted fellow citizens, striking for their own gain at everyone else’s expense.

\section*{Form of Government} 
The \pShippies{} have a consensus based representational democracy. Dolphins and gulls are used to spread messages calling groups to discuss policy, and disseminating decisions. The government consists of four levels:

\begin{enumerate}	
	\item The \textbf{Ships:} The ships are the smallest unit within the \pShip{} government. Each ``Ship'' is comprised of the crew of each ship, or the members of each household in a town. Each ship gets to make its own rules, as long as they don’t violate the (not particularly restrictive) edicts from the larger governing bodies. Everyone 14 years and older is allowed to participate in policy discussions, which continue until consensus is achieved. When necessary, a representative (typically the first mate) will be sent on to the Raft.
		\item The \textbf{Rafts:} A ``Raft'' is composed of all of the Ships that call the same port home. They convene to discuss matters of local importance whenever they arise, or when called upon for a vote by the larger governing bodies.
		\item The \textbf{Fleets:} A ``Fleet'' is composed of all of the Raft from a geographic area. Each geographic area is identified by a 1/12th arc of a clock, centered in the middle of the continent. The sections are numbered 1-12, starting N to NE (the 12-1 slice). Fleets are based on their port location, not the current location of a Ship.
		\item The \textbf{Council of Storm-Watchers:} The high council of the \pShip{}. This group of 12 elected officials are the highest governing body. No nation wide policy is enacted without the approval of the expanded council, made up of the 12 ``Storm-Watchers'' and the 12 representatives, one from each Fleets.
\end{enumerate}

Different ships go in for different levels of hierarchy. Some are very casual, barely distinguishing between a formal consensus building session for policy, and regular life. Others, especially those that regularly hunt sea serpents, observe a strict, militaristic hierarchy.

\section*{Religion, Morality, and Magic}
The \pShippies{} primarily serve the dual \cEbb{\God}es, \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}. \cEbbFull{\MYname}, is the primary keeper of ships, and the caretaker of things lost or taken away. \cFlowFull{\MYname}, is the primary keeper of the rain, and the caretaker of things created or given. They preside jointly over the sea and their people.

\emph{Players will create some rituals of the culture in workshops before game.}

There are whispers in \pShip{} about a growing tide of a new religion, one that preaches ``true'' balance and equality, but achieves it through questionable means. The wildest reports claim that entire ships have converted from the loving embrace of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{} to this unknown new Deity -- but proof of these claims is in short supply.

\subsection*{Morals}
\cEbb{} and \cFlow{} demand a morality primarily of balance. Give and take is fundamental to the \pShip{} viewpoint on the world. Whatever you get, you are expected to give back in equal or greater measure. In theory, this creates a fair and equitable society -- but in practice, it doesn't. Those who have, give to each other, containing their wealth and indeed multiplying it by passing it amongst each other. The rest struggle to make ends meet, as they can only pass scraps. 

There is also an ebb and flow among the \pShippies{} of good and ill will. If someone does you a bad turn, you are expected to harm them in return. This creates localized escalations, and they can spread from these points of conflict, like ripples on a pond, to encompass vast swaths of \pShip{} territory.

\subsection*{Magic}
The magic of \pShip{} is a subtle one. It lives in the hands of the shipwright, the fisherfolk, the harpoon-maker, and the cooks. Their magic is tied to crafting, the sea, and the purpose of the object made. So subtle is their magic that there are some in \pFarm{} and \pTech{} that look down their nose at the \pShippies{}, and claim their magic of no consequence. But by the will of \cEbb{\full}, and the skill of a master shipwright (among the most revered magic users in the \pShip{}), a ship built by the \pShippies{} will always be higher quality. And so is anything else a \pShippie{} craftsperson puts their skill to. For those with eyes open, the magic of the \pShippies{} makes daily life possible in \pEarth{}. Without it, the \pShippies{} would be no more.

\section*{Economics and Industry}
In pre-war times, the domestic economy of \pShip{} was based on trade and artisanal crafts. Economic interactions with the other two countries were a mix of fees (paid freely or extorted) to guard against sea serpents, and the delivery fees to transport goods and materials. Currently, the \pShip{} rely a lot on goods seized from the other nations.

\subsection*{Immigration and Emigration}
Before the betrayal, attempts at immigration to \pShip{} were relatively common compared to other nations. The appeal of a seemingly carefree life was strong. But joining the \pShippies{} is dangerous. For those not born on a ship, the 3 year probationary period is harsh and particularly dangerous, while they become accustomed to life at sea. Emigration was fairly common also. The austere life of the \pShip{} as well as the whims of the sea drive many to seek safety on dry land.

\section*{Culture}
The \pShip{} culture is one of wanderlust and restlessness. Adventurous spirits pervade, and detailed planning is eschewed in favor of following where the wind takes you. Camaraderie among a crew is paramount, with fellowship within a chosen family holding much stronger sway than any blood tie.

Many \pShippies{} from the richer fleets live in at least 5 different communities in their life. Life for those in the poorer fleets, particularly the 8th and 9th fleets, is a lot more restricted. Moving is costly, both to the individual and to the community receiving the new mouthes. Without enough resources to go around, ships will often reject requests to join, and a ship that strikes unusual good fortune will quickly be overwhelmed by requests to join. There is also rampant discrimination, both subtle and overt, that prevents poorer people from moving to ships in richer fleets and thereby escaping their poverty.

\subsection{Art and Entertainment}
\pShippies{}s don't go in much for pure aesthetics. If it isn't functional, it's dead weight, and dead weight could be the difference between running afoul of a reef and escaping that sea serpent chasing you. The most skilled crafters can make something that is both functional and beautiful; this form of minimalism is highly prized. \pShippies{} also tend towards song, dance, and storytelling in their artistry.

\subsection*{Family Structure}
Chosen family is far more important to \pShippies{} than blood family. Children are raised communally, and children as young as 7 are regularly allowed to change ships if they so desire, as long as the other ship will accept them. There is no particular pressure to have children or maintain ties with parents, partners, or children.

Names are composed of a single personal name, which people change not infrequently, the name of their ship, and the fleet to which it belongs, as a suffix. For example: \cLoud{\full}. (OOC Note: We discourage players from casually changing their character name in the middle of game for the sake of your fellow players.)

\subsection{Educational system:}
Children are homeschooled up through the 6th grade. Students are then expected to study at least 4 years at one of the 12 academies (one per fleet). Most of the academies have entrance exams, but the Academies in 8th and 9th fleet accept anyone. The academies offer advanced study courses beyond the 8th year, but attendance dwindles significantly with each additional year.

The \pShip{} \pSchool{} students are elected from a pool of candidates by the whole nation, and the students campaign with the support of their academy. Since the academy pays the tuition to the \pSc{}, it is theoretically possible for anyone to attend. In reality, the poorer fleets can’t mount the necessary campaign to get a student elected, and couldn’t afford the tuition anyway.

\subsection*{Taboos}
A \pShippie{} should not go a year and a day without bathing in sea-water. They should never fail to give honor to the \cEbb{\God}es for anything they create, and it should always bear the seal of the maker’s patron \cEbb{\God}. And finally, they should never let an action done to them go unmatched.

\subsection{Clothing:}
The \pShip{} tend toward blues, greens, purples, and gray. They often dress simply, but in layers. Fabric can be plain, or have patterns that evoke light on the water and other natural phenomenons. The most common kinds of jewelry pay homage to the ocean, or to the \cEbb{\God}es. Above all, the \pShippies{} eschew flashiness and extravagance.
