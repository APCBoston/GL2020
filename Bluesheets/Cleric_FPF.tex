To be a Cleric of \cTechGod{} is to be a pillar of stability for the people of the \pTech{}. You are a spiritual beacon to your people, interpreting the will of \cTechGod{} for the masses. It is your solemn duty to both encourage the innovation that is the lifeblood of your society, and curb its excesses in order to permit only gradual, carefully controlled changes.  

\section*{A Cleric's Powers and Responsibilities}
The Temple strictly regulates use of magic and places limitations on technology. Ostensibly, they do this in the interest of maintaining the wellbeing, freedom, and equality of the people and the nation as a whole. In actuality, decisions about which technology and magic to permit and to whom are all too often arbitrary or corrupt, motivated as much by greed, lust for power, or fear of change as they are by any high ideals.  Whatever the motivations, the Priesthood jealously guards its sole authority to gatekeep technological advancements.

Clerics of \cTechGod{} are taught the ability to imbue a new piece of technology with magic, thus making it function. Some of the highest ranking also have the ability to authorize a design to be sent to production in order to make the technology available to the people of \pTech{}. (Technically the High Priest is not among those with this authority.) Lower ranking Clerics have the power to diagnose and repair broken things. Much of their magical energy is directed toward imbuing the technology coming off production lines.

While many are charged with authorizing and imbuing new technology, there are other roles for a Cleric. Some serve primarily as spiritual guides. Others are charged with caring for the Celestial Beetles and recording their runic messages. And some few are assigned to the Temple’s spy network, a crucial tool in maintaining social stability, curtailing the blasphemous black market that deals in stolen tech, and maintaining an edge against the other nations.

\subsection*{Temple History and Structure}
The temple was founded at the beginning of times, at the birth of the Nation, by the Grace of \cTechGod{}. From the original Circle of Five, the Temple has grown to include many Clerics who serve all over the \pTech{}.

The current Circle of Five are the highest Officers of the Temple. They govern according to a written body of religious laws. A series of middle managers divide up the country into increasingly smaller areas, until individual Clerics are able to work directly with up to a few dozen of \cTechGod{}'s followers under the supportive umbrella of the Temple at large.

\section*{The Celestial Beetles}
The Avatars of Kero, the Celestial Beetles, are housed in the High Temple of Kero, where they are kept safe by elite guards. As noted above, dedicated clerics are charged with caring for them and recording their messages. The Beetles write two kinds of messages, public and private. Messages meant for the public record are written in ordinary ink for all to see. Private messages sent to individual clerics – usually only the highest ranking ones – are written in special ink that vanishes as if it were never there after the message is read. The latter are rare, and difficult to verify beyond the recipient’s word, but \cTechGod{} works in mysterious ways.
