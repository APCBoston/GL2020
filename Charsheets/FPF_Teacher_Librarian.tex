%% Rachel Reddick AKA Rachel AKA FPF Teacher Librarian

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the character's current life, problems, and priorities. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life. Current life and situation.   What they think about the most important contacts

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.

Librarian??  Researcher... Amnesiac???  Killed someone who was in severe pain but doesn't remember it, spends game trying to figure out who did I kill and why, am I a bad guy, how do I keep this secret.

Religious, for personal reasons rather than public ones

\cLibrarian{} cares about order, calm, organization, status quo, and helping solve problems.  She finds satisfaction in the library.  The more she engages with the library, the more library memories come back to her, but not the personal knowledge.  The gods punish her less by letting her have a few memories back because she was very devout, and killed out of kindness.  The FPF god doesn't want other gods to know.

\cEthics{} is their friend/ally, know they are an amnesiac, so does \cInterpol{}, lesser ally, doesn't know who they killed, but is convinced they are a good person.

find out who/why killed someone, make ritual happen, don't let people steal relics!, Amnesiac Relationship,
