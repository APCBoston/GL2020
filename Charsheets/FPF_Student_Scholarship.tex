\name{\cScholarship{}}

You are \cScholarship{} (\cScholarship{\they}/\cScholarship{\them}) - 21 years old, and very magically talented. As an orphan from \pTech{}, you are only able to attend school on a religious scholarship - and because of that, your position at \pSchool{} is distressingly precarious.

You have never known your parents. Instead, your first memories are from an orphanage. It wasn’t bad as such, but neither was it a home. Your interest in religion initially spawned from the comfort that your spirituality brought you when times were hard. When the Church agreed to take you in as a teenager, you were overjoyed. Unfortunately, that joy was short lived when \cAntiChup{} came into your life. After taking an interest in you, \cAntiChup{} took charge of every aspect of your upbringing, curating your education and eventually starting to use you as an errand \cScholarship{\kid}. Over the course of several years, the errands became more difficult, important, and dangerous - but none took you far from \cAntiChup{}’s watchful eye for long.

You hoped things would change once you reached \pSchool{}. \cAntiChup{} had been surprisingly supportive of your desire to attend the \pSc{}, although it would soon become obvious why - \cAntiChup{\they} wanted an agent on the inside. And with \cAntiChup{} in charge of the scholarship that allows you to attend, your position is contingent on continuing to please \cAntiChup{\them}. Still, at \pSchool{}, you got your first taste of something that resembled freedom. And you wanted more of it.

Under \cAntiChup{}’s direction, you ``borrowed’’ the \iNet{} from the \pSc{} library, and on a recent school break, you hunted down the Avatar of \cEbb{\full}, one of the two \pShip{} Avatars, and killed it. The action gave \pTech{} the upper hand in the war by eliminating the connection between \pShip{} and their Goddesses, but it also broke the connection between the \iNet{} and \pShip{}. You managed to sneak the \iNet{} back into the library, but it needs to be re-attuned to \pShip{} before anyone finds out, and traces the crime back to you. To do that, you’ll need to make sure the ritual to renew the Ley Lines happens as soon as possible, as it is a prerequisite.

While this killing was the most impactful, this is hardly the first crime \cAntiChup{} has forced you to commit, and that pattern is exactly why you don’t intend to answer to \cAntiChup{} forever. In fact you have plans to end that this very weekend. The crux is the \iScholarship{}. It is currently made out in \cAntiChup{}’s name. You need to find a way to convince \cAntiChup{} to sign it over to another member of the Church - presumably \cBeetle{}. Of course, this requires convincing \cBeetle{} to accept you. You plan to accomplish that via a pet research project you’ve been working on - researching The War of the Gods. The War is a hotly contested topic among religious scholars across \pEarth{}, and \cBeetle{} is a premier scholar. Discovering something previously unknown about the War will surely impress \cBeetle{\them}.

\cAntiChup{} is always plotting, and always tasking you with carrying out those plots. At the moment, the plot \cAntiChup{\they} \cAntiChup{\have} given you is to try to find blackmail on either \cInitiate{} or \cPirate{}, and to forge magical blackmail on the other. You’re not sure what exactly \cAntiChup{\they} want\cAntiChup{\plural} with that blackmail, but you do know that taking on this one last task will make \cAntiChup{} significantly more likely to sign over the \iScholarship{} - at least, if you bargain right.

Besides \cAntiChup{}’s plans for the weekend, you have plans of your own too, thank you very much! You know that voting authority for where to direct the storm involves approval from the advisors, which you are sure \cAntiChup{} can arrange, from the teachers, and from the Gods themselves. Your piety is unmatched by your fellow students, and comes naturally to you, so you aren’t worried about that. Having the most votes toward where to direct the storm will be a solid first step toward building your own power.

Speaking of power, money is power in \pTech{}. From \cAntiChup{}’s mutterings and the magical technology that sometimes appears around school, you are fairly certain that there’s a black market presence at the school. You’re not sure you would have much of value to sell, but if you could get your hands on something and resell it, it would go a long way to giving you a backup plan if things went south in your attempts to escape from \cAntiChup{} - and give you a lot more flexibility if things turn out alright.

If everything goes well, by the end of this weekend, you will be free of \cAntiChup{}’s control, and well on your way to establishing your own power base in the Church. If you can keep your reputation from being tarnished by the revelation of your part in the death of \cEbb{}’s Avatar, so much the better. The \pSchool{} has finally given you a taste of what it means to be your own person - and you intend to solidify that here and now.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Re-attune the \iNet{} before anyone discovers what you did. The ritual to renew the Ley Lines must be completed in order to do this.
	\item Earn as much voting authority for directing the storm as you can.
	\item Make as much money on the black market as possible.
	\item Convince another member of the \pTech{} clergy, presumably \cBeetle{} to take over your scholarship.
	\item Find blackmail on \cInitiate{} and/or \cPirate{} and create the magical blackmail to use on the other in order to stay in \cAntiChup{}’s good graces
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You are in your second of three years at the \pSchool{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cAntiChup{}} Your shady mentor and foster \cAntiChup{\parent}. You owe \cAntiChup{\them} a lot, and you love \cAntiChup{\them}, but you need to be your own person. And hopefully be forced to commit fewer crimes.
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} Another member of the \pTech{} clergy. You hope to convince \cBeetle{\them} to take over sponsoring your scholarship.
