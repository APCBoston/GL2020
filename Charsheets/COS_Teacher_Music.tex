%% Dana AKA COS Teacher Music

You are \cMusic{} (\cMusic{\they}\textbackslash\cMusic{\them}), and you are 52 years old. You are from \pFarm{} and work as the Music teacher at the \pSchool{}. You are a devout follower of \cFarmGod{} and your spirituality is an important part of who you are. You are caring, approachable, and devoted to the well being of all in your care. The balance of the world was broken 6 years ago, and you are in a position to help fix it now - so that's just what you intend to do.

Your early life was easy, since your family is old, landed nobility. You had the best education possible, including several focus programs. In one about the religions of \pEarth{}, you were assigned a pen pal in \pTech{}. \cBeetle{} and you were a surprisingly good match, and you maintained your correspondence long after the program ended. 

With several elder siblings, you had always had the freedom to explore what called to you.  You came to love music from a young age, and it was the first thing that drew you to the church. You spent several years studying the spiritual and healing practice of music and preparing to enter the priesthood, encouraged by your family for the status boost it would have provided, only to realize that your true calling lay in teaching.  Your family was initially disappointed - teaching being a noble profession but nowhere near as prestigious as joining the Priesthood - but were ultimately appeased when you landed a position as the music teacher at the \pSchool{} 18 years ago. Marriage has never appealed to you, but you consider every student who passes through the school to be one of your children and care for them as deeply as if they were your own flesh and blood.

After 12 years at the \pSchool{}, you were feeling pretty comfortable in your life, but then everything seemed to go wrong at once. Twelve students were killed in a devastating tragedy as the school’s most important ritual went awry, the decades old international treaty between the three nations was broken, the \pShip{} were betrayed, and a war started soon after. You were shaken to your core.  After you emerged from your grief over your lost children, you realized that it was time to take a more active role in the world around you.

Since the ritual went awry six years ago, you have taken a significant interest in ensuring that this crucial event goes smoothly and that the right students participate and vote wisely.  Under your watchful eye matters have gone better, and you know \cPrincipal{} appreciates your efforts in ensuring the safety and success of the students. While nobody could reasonably solve all of this themselves, you know as a teacher that your best way to make a difference is to take on a greater role in guiding the students' morals and helping them to decide for themselves the solutions that would best preserve their futures.

When \cPrincipal{} announced at the beginning of the year that \cPrincipal{\they} would be retiring, you knew that you were meant for the role. \cPrincipal{}, seeing that both you and your good friend \cBeetle{} are both good candidates for the position, has asked that you oversee the arrangements for this year’s Graduation Ceremony.  You know \cPrincipal{} is both counting on you and judging your performance against \cBeetle{}’s.  Your friendship, built over the years, has only deepened during your time working together at \pSchool{}.  Despite your friendly rivalry over the position, you are confident that there is no one else at the school who would be a better choice for the position (other than yourself, of course)!

On a personal level, you’re also excited by the news that your friend \cInterpol{} is interested in forming a romantic relationship with \cBeetle{} and \cJuniorStatesman{}, who are already a couple.  As you’re close friends and recent professional rivals with \cBeetle{}, you are in the perfect position to be \cInterpol{}’s wing\cMusic{\person}.  

You’ve also been paying special attention to \cAdopted{}, the adopted \cAdopted{\child} of your \cAdoptedParentOne{\nibling}. \cAdopted{} has for the most part avoided your efforts to become closer, but you know family will matter to \cAdopted{\them} when \cAdopted{\theyare} older, so you persist. It saddens you that \cAdopted{} doesn’t seem to appreciate or value \cAdopted{\their} adopted family as \cAdopted{\they} should.

With three days remaining before the voting and the ritual to control the storm, all of your hard work is coming together.  Soon you’ll see the fruits of your labor in the form of a promotion, increased hope for balance in the world, and a successful conclusion to the school year. Assuming, of course, that everything goes according to plan.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Ensure that the preparations for the ritual go off without a hitch.
	\item Encourage the students to show compassion in their voting and undo the betrayal of the \pShip{}.
	\item Win the promotion to Principal.
\item Put on a phenomenal Graduation Ceremony and accompanying Student Demonstration. This will help with impressing \cPrincipal{}.
\item Get \cInterpol{} together with \cBeetle{} and/or \cJuniorStatesman{}

(35) Graduation Ceremony/Demonstration - Put in charge by Zev to test her organization skills. If she does well here it should increase her chances of getting the principality.
