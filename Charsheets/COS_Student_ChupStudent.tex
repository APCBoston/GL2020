\name{\cChupStudent{}}
 
You are \cChupStudent{\full} (\cChupStudent{\they}/\cChupStudent{\them}), and an 18 year old, first year student from the \pFarm{}. Most importantly, you are a zealous devotee of the \pGoaties{}---and this weekend is your big break. Just like the rest of your group, you conceal your true abilities. Your reputation is that of a slacker who skates by on \cChupStudent{\their} magical power---but you are cunning, dangerous\ldots{}and here to win.
 
You were born the second \cChupStudent{\child} of powerful nobles who control land along the \pTech{} border (luckily not coastal, so you don't have to deal with pirates---the \cWildCard{\formal}s get to deal with that). While this afforded you a privileged life, it didn't provide much in the way of future prospects---you were betrothed to a foreigner at a young age for political gain. The certainty that your life was not in your hands has always bothered you. Even being born with all of the magical power in the world into a politically powerful family, you were \textbf{still} doomed to be a pawn simply by virtue of being born second. The vast majority of people in this world were born with less than you in every way---and yet, your future \textbf{still} felt dim and lifeless. The feeling of helplessness combined with the guilt of having so much left you in a dark place mentally for many years.
 
That was all up until that fateful day. One day when you were 13 years old, you were out on a leisurely survey of your family's lands with your servants when you heard distant screams and saw smoke rising from one of your peasant villages. You and your escorts hurried to the scene; when you arrived, you found the smoldering ruins of a barn, and a group of enraptured peasants surrounding a strange \cChupLeader{\person}. Apparently, the barn had caught fire, this stranger had raced in and rescued those trapped inside, and \cChupLeader{\they} \cChupLeader{\were} now in the process of giving a sermon to the peasants. \cChupLeader{\They} spoke about true equality---an even platform for all who would stand on it. About the injustices of the caste system, the tyranny of those with power, and about how only through re-imagining the world could it be made fair. 
 
While you were as enraptured as your farmers, your escorts were not as thrilled. They wanted to arrest the man for sedition. But at a word from you, they left the \cChupLeader{\person} be. Second \cChupStudent{\child} you may be, but you still had (and have) considerable authority. You returned to your home with much to think about, after giving \cChupLeader{\them} a small amount of gold for saving your citizens.
 
That incident single-handedly changed you. No more were you willing to lament your fate---you now knew that there were people out there willing to fight to change it. You began sharpening your mind and your skills in preparation to be one of those people. Two years later, after much clandestine searching, you managed to find them---and join them. They call themselves the \pGoaties{}, and they were everything you hoped. A year later your training was done, and you were a full fledged member, ready to do anything it took to bring the world closer to true equity. Between your true skills, your family's backing, and that of your new group, it was simple to qualify for your first mission---infiltrating the \pSchool{}.
 
Your time at the \pSc{} has been pretty successful. You have grown your knowledge and power, as well as met a few friends along the way. Chief among them is \cAmbition{\full}, your friend from the \pTech{} and a cunning mind to rival your own. \cAmbition{} is the only person to have seen through your slacker persona, and pesters you to drop it so that you can realize your full potential. But even without that, you'd say you've done pretty well for yourself. Through your connections, magical strength, and showing strategic flashes of your true abilities, you have managed to be recognized as a prized student and are the current forerunner for the highest voting authority for the \pFarm{}. Some of the other students are jealous, but that can't be helped.
 
Now that you're here and this crucial moment in time has come, you have a few important missions to accomplish. Your primary mission, given to you personally by the esteemed \cChupLeader{\full}, leader of the \pGoaties{} (and selfsame \cChupLeader{\person} who saved your farmers all those years ago), is to make sure that the Storm is sent to the \pSc{}. There are a few aspects to accomplishing this. First of all, the more votes you can gain in the selection process, the better (see your Greensheets for details). This is made more challenging by your falsely dull persona, but you think you can maintain your current lead without tipping your hand if you are careful---the teachers all love you after all, since you excel effortlessly in their classes. And you definitely have the magical power to back it up, plus the support of the other Followers of Genesis in attendance. In addition to winning the most votes, you have other ways to manipulate the outcome of the voting (see your Abilities). In order to make the school a valid target for the Storm so that your hard earned votes don't just fizzle, other Followers of Genesis are working on installing a Relic attuned to the school, instead of to one of the nations, in the Ritual to Control the Storm. All of this will be difficult and dangerous---but at the end of the day, if destroying the \pSc{} makes the statement you're hoping for, you'll have done your job.
 
In order to ensure everyone else is too distracted to interfere with your group's efforts to target the Storm at the school, you and \cChupSecond{\full}, the second in command of the Followers of Genesis, sabotaged the Bunkers. \cChupSecond{} has assured you that damaging the Bunkers is just a distraction, and that, given their crucial importance to people's ability to survive the Storm, those present will undoubtedly mobilize in droves and repair the Bunkers before the Storm strikes. As long as they are fixed in time, they'll protect everyone here from the Storm. With the sabotage complete, all you have to do is make sure as many people as possible remain busy and distracted with the repair efforts. It's a mission that will require subtlety, but fortunately, that's your specialty.
 
You also have a secondary mission to take care of. Leader \cChupLeader{} has asked you a personal favor---you are to investigate possible treason by \cChupSecond{}, who is suspected of trying to usurp control over the group from \cChupLeader{}. You're incredibly honored to receive this request, and you intend to fulfill it to your utmost potential. 
 
There is also the matter of recruitment. You'd dearly love to recruit your best friend \cAmbition{} into the Followers of Genesis, not only to gain a powerful mage and talented mind, but also to protect \cAmbition{\them} from any fallout from your plans this weekend. \cAmbition{} is defined by \cAmbition{\their} ambition, and you think you have a good chance at convincing \cAmbition{\them} to join based on that alone---but if that isn't enough, you think you can sell \cAmbition{\them} on the angle that the \pGoaties{} are the underdog, since \cAmbition{} clawed \cAmbition{\their} way up from a poor background. You've already put some effort into grooming \cAmbition{\them} for recruitment, stoking \cAmbition{\their} dissatisfaction with life. The time is ripe to make your move. Besides \cAmbition{}, you have a general charter to recruit anybody that you think would be a good fit for the group. \cAdopted{} and \cLibAssist{} might be good candidates too; they seem dissatisfied with their lot in life. But they could also reject the group violently, and blow the whole group's cover. You'd need to approach them very carefully. \cDisney{}, as a \cDisney{\cleric} of \cFarmGod{} is surely beyond your reach.
 
On a more personal and \emph{awkward} note, you have had an ongoing\ldots{} THING with another student named \cHeir{\full}. On your first day at the school, you found that \cHeir{}, your betrothed since you were children, was also attending. You had met several times when you were much younger, and had always cultivated a deep and mutual animosity for each other due to the unfairness of the situation. Unfortunately, that all came shattering down when you first laid eyes on \cHeir{\them} on orientation day. \cHeir{} had grown up HOT. You think you've managed to avoid giving away your newfound attraction until now---but that doesn't make it go away. Why did this have to become so very confusing?
 
You've been hanging around \cHeir{} and \cAmbition{}, afraid that they have feelings for each other. You weren't exactly spying, but you did overhear enough to reassure you that \cAmbition{} and \cHeir{} aren't romantically interested in each other. Instead, you've learned that \cHeir{} isn't really fond of the idea of being the heir apparent to the \cHeir{\formal} family. \cHeir{\Their} older \cHeirSibling{\sibling}, \cHeirSibling{}, was supposed to have that role, but \cHeirSibling{} was one of the students killed 6 years ago. So now the burden falls to \cHeir{}, who isn't sure \cHeir{\they} can rise to the occasion. You think \cHeir{\theyare} selling \cHeir{\them}self short---but how can you tell \cHeir{\them} so?

Further complicating this is your budding attraction for another student, \cPresident{}. You're pretty sure that \cPresident{} has been checking you out for a while now---and that attention is certainly welcome. As the student body president, \cPresident{} is capable, charismatic, and attractive. You aren't sure how you'll choose between the two, and you really wish you didn't have to---especially in such a short time frame. You know you have so many unjust privileges over commoners, but you do envy their freedom in matters of love. They get to marry whomever and however many people they wish, while you as a noble are expected to form a monogamous union with the scion of another powerful family. It makes you want all the more to overthrow the established order.

You were still sorting out your feelings when, this morning, you received some horrible news in the form of a letter delivered by an advisor named \cDiplomat{\full}. \cDiplomat{} has worked for the \cHeir{\formal} family for years and is often their errand \cDiplomat{\kid}. It seems your meddling parents have set your wedding to \cHeir{} to be THIS MONDAY. You weren't even remotely ready to make a choice yet---and you resent them for forcing you into this without your knowledge. You're conflicted about accepting under these circumstances---particularly with the \pGoaties{} plans for this weekend already in motion. If they had just stayed out of this, you might have proposed to \cHeir{} on your own in a few years. Why must parents meddle?
 
On a less personal note, you've been watching \cEvil{\full} since \cEvil{\they} arrived this morning. \cEvil{\Theyare} a ruthless political player who has been a thorn in your family's side for years. You don't have any proof, but you're sure \cEvil{\they} must be up to something shady this weekend. If you can get enough dirt on \cEvil{\them}, maybe you can leverage it to make \cEvil{\them} leave your family alone permanently. 
 
This weekend will be jam-packed.You have a few personal matters of love to resolve---and, you have a lot of work to do for your group. If you can manage to pull off this incredible feat, your Patron Deity will finally go mainstream---and you can finally step unburdened from the shadows.
 
\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Ensure you get the highest voting authority among the Children of the Sun and manipulate the votes to ensure that the Storm is sent to \pSc{}.
	\item Surreptitiously work with \cChupSecond{} to keep as many people as possible focused on repairing the Bunkers, both to distract them from the true purpose of the \pGoaties{} this weekend, and to make sure the Bunkers are repaired before the Storm strikes.
	\item Recruit \cAmbition{} to the \pGoaties{}---as well as anyone else who would be a good candidate, without getting caught by unsympathetic parties.
	\item Decide what you want to do with your romantic future---allow yourself to be wed to \cHeir{}, or pursue \cPresident{}. If only you could find a way to be with both\ldots{}
	\item Help investigate \cChupSecond{} on behalf of \cChupLeader{}.
	\item See if you can get enough dirt on \cEvil{} to blackmail \cEvil{\them} into leaving your family alone.
