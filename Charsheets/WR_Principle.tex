%Zev AKA WR Principal

You are \cPrincipal{} (\cPrincipal{\they}\textbackslash\cPrincipal{\them}). You grew up in \pShip{} 300 years ago and followed your aspiration as a teacher all the way to \pSchool{}. Near what you thought was the end of your career, you were chosen to be the next Principal. As the head of this important institution, you have been granted immortality by the Gods until you name your successor and pass on your mantle - something you have finally resolved to do. You are tired - oh so very tired - and it is finally time to let the young folk determine the course of the world.

The \pShip{} of your childhood doesn’t look all that different from the one of a decade ago. The Council of Stormwatchers was smaller, the rituals less elaborate, and food was a little blander. Still, everything was mostly the same, except for one important thing - the pirates. While It’s true that when you took on the Principality, you foreswore your ties to the \pShippies{}, you have watched from a distance as the scourge of piracy slowly began to overtake your homeland. Watching their rise has been the hardest thing about remaining impartial and devoting yourself to the school, even more so than the recent war. Conflicts come and go - societal rot is harder to root out. And so you worry for the \pShip{} daily.

The curse of immortality is, of course, watching those you care about pass on without you. The people you grew up with, taught with, they are all gone. It’s not that you don’t value your current colleagues, it's just that with every passing year, you feel more distant from them, more removed from the world.

At the beginning of the school year, you announced your intentions to retire, and called for nominations for your successor. Over the past few months, you have evaluated a number of candidates, most of whom are teachers at the school. You believe you’ve narrowed your decision down to 2 finalists: \cMusic{} and \cBeetle{}. To that end, you’ve given each of them charge over two of the most important activities in the last few days leading up to the Storm. \cMusic{} is in charge of the Graduation Ceremony - a fitting challenge for someone who has struggled to manage logistics in the past. \cBeetle{} is in charge of renewing the leylines that keep the school afloat. You feel it will be a good test of whether \cBeetle{\they} can let go \cBeetle{\their} ties to \pTech{}. While you are reasonably sure these two are up to at least the basics of these tasks, you have not discounted the possibility that you’ll need to step in to make sure the tasks are completed correctly. And you are not above considering a dark horse candidate, even at this late stage, if they prove themselves invaluable to the maintenance of the school.

The other preparation to be made for the Storm, is the ritual itself. In order for the votes cast by the students to do anything, the Ritual must be set up in exacting detail. It requires relics and careful preparation, and cooperation on all sides. The relics are powerful artifacts in their own right, made more powerful by the magical charge granted them by the growing power of the storm. Several attempts have been made to steal relics over the decades. You remember one fateful time, about 200 years ago, that one of the \pFarm{} relics disappeared. It took years of fevered work by the priesthood to sanctify a new one. You are committed to allowing no relic to leave the island in the possession of someone untrustworthy, and intend to impress the same upon your successor, whoever you should choose.

The other half of this is the voting. Students from each nation will get a certain number of votes to cast toward where to send the storm. Both the teachers and the advisors play a role in deciding how many votes each student should get. And it is your unenviable task to make sure it all happens. Not only are you in charge of getting the signed, ranked voting from the teachers of each nation, but you have to be the tiebreaker and somehow maintain your impartiality. Worse than the teachers even are the advisors, it is your job to convince them all to vote in a timely fashion.

Among the most recent crop of teachers, you have found an unexpectedly close friend in \cChupAvenger{}. \cChupAvenger{} seems to uniquely bring a smile to your face with \cChupAvenger{\their} antics, and reminds you of yourself in your younger days. As of late, though, \cChupAvenger{} has been in some trouble of the religious variety. Over the last few weeks, you gradually came to notice some odd behavior on the part of the teachers at your school with regards to \cChupAvenger{} - they had come to forget \cChupAvenger{\them}. It took serious research, among some of the most obscure texts in the library to figure out what was really happening. 

You immediately rushed to confront \cChupAvenger{}, and got the full story. Near the start of the war, \cChupAvenger{}’s anger about the war caused \cChupAvenger{\them} to rashly renounce \cChupAvenger{\their} religion and join the \pGoaties{}, even committing the primary taboo of this world - murder - in \cGenesis{}’ name. Murders done by devotees of \cGenesis{} don’t have the same penalties as the other gods. Instead of losing your own memories, others forget you instead. This was a shock to you when you found out - but in talking to \cChupAvenger{}, you have come to understand why \cChupAvenger{\they} did what \cChupAvenger{\they} did, and truly see the remorse \cChupAvenger{\they} have for those actions. You have since taken it upon yourself to help \cChupAvenger{} escape from that life, and cover for \cChupAvenger{\them} in the meantime.

After this storm is concluded, you just want to retire in peace. No longer immortal, you’ll live out the rest of your life somewhere, preferably far away from the conflict. Your time will be spent in quiet reflection until it’s safe to travel - and then, you want to see the world, experiencing all of the sights you haven’t been able to for hundreds of years.

All that will take is a smooth transition to the next generation. If you can make it out of here with a strong successor picked, the relics in their proper places, and your friend \cChupAvenger{} safe, sound, and ideally by your side, you will be able to finally rest.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Decide on who should succeed you as the immortal Principal of the \pSchool{}. Enact the transfer of power before the Storm is sent. \emph(Before end of game).
	\item Keep an eye on \cMusic{} and \cBeetle{} as they complete the tasks you’ve set for them.
	\item Ensure that no relics leave the island in the possession of someone untrustworthy, especially pirates.
	\item Make sure that the voting goes smoothly and impartially, and the votes are tallied accurately
	\item Help \cChupAvenger{} mend their ways, and return to the good graces of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}.

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cChupAvenger{}} Your best friend in the current era. Has made some bad choices, but is a fundamentally good person.
	\contact{\cMusic{}} One of your two finalists for succession. A little scattered, but seems to be growing at a rapid pace.
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} One of your two finalists for succession. You think \cBeetle{\they} might be too attached to their nation, but \cBeetle{\theyare} otherwise extremely competent.
