\name{\cChupSecond{}}

You are \cChupSecond{\full} (\cChupSecond{\they}/\cChupSecond{\them}), and the mastermind behind the growing success of the \pGoaties{}. Your fellow teachers think you are just a loner who teaches Economics at the \pSchool{}, but you are so much more - you are the epicenter of the black market on \pEarth{}, and soon to be leader of the \pGoaties{}.

Where \cChupLeader{}, the leader of the group, is bombastic, you speak truthfully and realistically. Where \cChupLeader{} agitates for immediate action, you are patient and plan for the long game. Where \cChupLeader{} has their head in the clouds, you have your feet on the ground. \cChupLeader{} uses charisma magic to hoodwink people into joining the cause, you truly change hearts and minds.

You don’t remember your parents, and you were sick for a very long time. Between sickness and trauma, you actually don’t remember almost any of your early life. Your first vivid memory is nine years ago when \cChupLeader{} pulled you out of the gutter from the poorest boat in the 9th fleet, and spoke words to you that made you feel alive for the first time. Those words were the promise of a better life, for you and all of \pEarth{} -- a world of true equity and inclusion. \cGenesis{} was a very minor \cGenesis{\Deity} of luck at the time, but through \cChupLeader{}, you learned of \cGenesis{}’s big plans to upset the whole pantheon. It all came down to Magic. 

Magic is a gift given to the people of \pEarth{} by the patron deities of the three countries -- and it was a gift that you didn’t get your fair share of. You are technically a magic user, but only barely. Things that others do without thinking are an incredible effort for you. You struggle to stay afloat while others float freely among the seabirds -- you struggle to light a fire when others can do it with barely a thought. And even still, you have it far better than those born without magic at all. Magic was no gift to humanity -- it was a curse. And \cGenesis{} has promised to undo that curse, while simultaneously bringing forth a new era where everyone will be judged on their merit, not on their inborn talents.

You’ve been working for almost a decade to build the necessary groundwork for that change. \cChupLeader{} thinks that now is the time to make the bid for power, and thus reveal the \pGoaties{} and their true intentions to the world. You, on the other hand, know that the group isn’t ready. Your group’s ostensible goal this weekend is to destroy the school as an assassination attempt on the assembled dignitaries and as a blow against the current  pantheon. In reality, the plan goes one step farther -- as destroying the \pSc{} will end magic on \pEarth{}. Only you and \cChupLeader{} know this, as you’ve kept it from literally everyone else present. You’ll only get one chance at this, and getting it to work is already uncertain. It WOULD be a masterstroke if it worked -- but the problem is the aftermath. With so many of the highest ranking members held in the group only by \cChupLeader{}’s magic, ending magic right now might well end the \pGoaties{} too, and destroy everything you’ve built. You’ve devoted your life to this cause, and you won’t let one over eager step bring it all to ruin. That’s why you need to take control before \cChupLeader{} ruins everything.

Of course, displacing the current leader, \cChupLeader{} is a delicate operation. You can’t just throw \cChupLeader{\them} to the wolves as it were; you’d reveal the whole group if you turned \cChupLeader{\them} over to the authorities. You considered trying to kill him, either with your own hands or through an avenger, but killing beloved leaders tends to turn them into martyrs. So you are left with one option: summoning the Avatar of \cGenesis{}. Conveniently enough, \cChupLeader{} put you in charge of this task. The \pGoaties{} need to do this to level the playing field with \cTechGod{} and \cFarmGod{}, making it a crucial group goal -- but it also has the interesting side effect that whoever \textbf{leads} that ritual will wield enormous clout in the group afterwards. No one would be able to deny that you are the proper leader after you receive the favor of \cGenesis{} after you summon the Avatar. Your claim will be further bolstered by the others who helped in the ritual. Their agreeing to work under you for this ritual will be nothing short of a pledge of loyalty to you.

Convincing \cChupInventor{} to join you could either be a piece of cake, or impossible. \cChupInventor{} has been with the group nearly as long as you. \cChupInventor{\Their} loyalty could go either way. If only you have a wedge to drive between \cChupInventor{} and \cChupLeader{}\ldots You wonder if \cChupLeader{} might be helping \cChupInventor{} cover up any secrets? \cChupLeader{} has a history of worming \cChupLeader{\their} way into people’s hearts, only to throw them under the caravan.

And then there’s the Avenger. Avenger’s are \cGenesis{}’s secret weapon. Under the auspices of \cGensis{}, someone who commits murder in \cGenesis{\their} name is forgotten by others, instead of forgotten themselves. Supposedly the upper echelons of the Followers are protected from forgetting because a tool forgotten is not of any use. But you are certain that you had arranged to have an Avenger here this weekend -- and you don’t remember them! That’s a bad sign, but of what you are not exactly sure. Either way, uncovering the Avenger and getting them on your side could be key.

Lastly, there is \cChupStudent{}. You have been working with \cChupStudent{\them} to sabotage the magical bunkers that protect people at the \pSchool{} during the run up to the storm. There’s only one step left to do some really serious damage to them. This sabotage is the \pGoaties{} main distraction from the work that \cChupLeader{} is overseeing. As long as \cChupLeader{} is in charge, and \cChupLeader{\their} plan is moving forward, you have to make sure people spend as little time as possible watching the relics, lest the group be revealed. Breaking the things that keep people safe, and then keeping the repair crews chasing their tails for as long as possible is crucial for that -- particularly when the luck of \cGenesis{} will protect you from the consequences.

But maybe we are putting the cart before the horse. You manage a lot of things for the \pGoaties{}, and have a lot of things to keep an eye on this weekend. Your most important ongoing responsibility is managing and maintaining the black market. In \pEarth{}, the flow of goods, technology, and information is very tightly controlled. Which leads to great demand among those who can’t get things -- particularly new technology from the \pTech{} since the war started. This, in turn, led to an opportunity for a thriving black market -- and you put in the work to make it happen.  Every serious piece of technology, resource, or snippet of information that goes through the market passes through your hands. You take in supplies from all over, and send them out again. It’s a lot of work, but it both maintains anonymity for as many people as possible while keeping transfer chains short, and ensures that no one can take that base of power away from you. Without you, the market would collapse within weeks, though not immediately - you do work closely with \cChupInventor{}, who helps supply many of the goods coming out of the \pTech{}.

Among the many things you’ve passed along recently, you took a particular interest in a \emph{liberated} load of goods from the \pFarm{}. The contact who passed off the fancy little box works with pirates, and they often had the most surprising little things for you. This box was no exception. It had a charm on it to keep it from being opened - a very powerful, good quality one. Intrigued, you reached out to an eccentric curseworker you’d commissioned before. \cCurse{} was delighted to work on so challenging a puzzle. But when they got the box open, and you saw the glint of something shiny, and even better quality than the box. You snatched it away before \cCurse{} could get a good enough look to identify it later. Then you handed off the fancy ring and it’s box to \cChupInventor{} to sell.

Another useful thing you’ve gotten off of the black market recently was a juicy piece of information -- someone else seems to have designs on the Avatars. There are quiet, unsubstantiated, but credible rumors on the black market that one of the \pShip{} Avatars has been killed, If so, this is valuable, pricey information that could sway the tide of the war in the right hands. It’s possible that the priests know more, so you should confirm it if you can. In the course of looking into this, you have also heard that no Giant Hummingbirds, the Avatars of \cFarmGod{} have been seen in six years. Could they be gone too? If so, it would give \cGenesis{} all the more of an edge to have \cGenesis{\their} Avatar on \pEarth{}.

While interesting in its own right, the black market isn’t all fun and games. You got caught up in a rather drama-filled mess a few weeks back that you had \textbf{not} bargained for. You’d been getting some goods from \cEthics{}, who was trading them for some other items on the black market. But after all the time you spent together, \cLibrarian{} became suspicious that you and \cEthics{} were romantically involved. Apparently \cLibrarian{} confronted \cEthics{}, and they broke up. So now \cLibrarian{} refuses to talk to \cEthics{}, and \cEthics{} is reluctant to continue working with you.

This weekend is a crucial turning point for you and the \pGoaties{}. You have a black market to run, a ritual to subvert, and an Avatar to summon -- not to mention your designs on group leadership that you need to keep under wraps. Delegation will be your friend, so long as you can trust the people you are delegating to -- and trustworthy people are hard to come by. This weekend will make or break the \pGoaties{}. It is your job to see the group through to the other side.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Seize control of the \pGoaties{} before \cChupLeader{}’s over zealous approach destroys everything you’ve worked for. Once you have control, you’ll have to make a decision on whether to proceed with the plan to send the storm to the school and destroy magic forever, or lay low, hold off, and wait for a better time.
	\item Lead the ritual to summon the \cGenesis{} Avatar. It’s important both for the greater goals of the group, and will give you a nearly indisputable claim to the leadership role.
	\item Work with \cChupStudent{} to finish sabotaging the bunkers, and then delay the repairs for as long as possible.
	\item Work with \cChupInventor{} to maintain the black market. The Storm is always a busy time with all the advisors here.
	\item Figure out who the Avenger is and recruit them to your side if you can 
\item Recruit anyone else who strikes you as a strong asset, without exposing the group to undue risk.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You’ve told the other members of the \pGoaties{} that the result of destroying the school will be only to cement \cGenesis{}’s place in the pantheon. Only you and \cChupLeader{} know that it will also end all human’s ability to use magic. You know that many people would be opposed to this true purpose, including \cChupInventor{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cChupLeader{}} The current leader of the \pGoaties{}. \cChupLeader{\They} are reckless and overzealous and \cChupLeader{\their} plans will get the group destroyed.
	\contact{\cChupInventor{}} Your second on the black market, \cChupInventor{} has been with the \pGoaties{} almost as long as you.
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} The student you are working with to sabotage the bunkers.
