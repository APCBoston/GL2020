\name{\cWildCard{}}

You are \cWildCard{\full} (\cWildCard{\they}/\cWildCard{\them}), and 42 years old. You are ostensibly here to support \cEvil{\full}, represent the will of \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{} in whatever negotiations the advisors attempt, and study the Relics of \pEarth{}. In reality you are more interested in gaining immortality -- and everything you need to achieve it is here on this floating island.

You are a scholar from the\pFarm{} -- one of the country’s best. You come from a wealthy, noble family -- not as old as some, but not newly landed either. You attended the \pSchool{} in your youth and are now an expert in the history and theory of magic. This means that unlike some, you know that there are many things that are still unknown about how magic works, or even how it came to be. You push the boundaries of what is possible in ways that few can even conceptualize.

There are a few stories from the time when magic was gifted to humanity that speak of free passage between the realm of mortals and that of the Gods. And tucked away in a little grotto somewhere, guarded by a chimeric beast, is a spring. From that spring bubbles an ambrosia of immortality. The story goes that the Gods bathed in this liquid, granting them their status out of time. If a human were to partake of that ambrosia either by bathing or imbibing, time would stop for them as well, and they would be as a God among men or an equal among the Gods. But no mortal was ever able to best the guardian, and in the time since, the Gods have severed all physical connections between the Divine Realm and \pEarth{}.

All other scholars believe therefore that the possibility of immortality is lost to humanity. You, however, know better. To achieve this, there are three things which must be accomplished, all of which are possible. One, you must acquire a weapon against the beast. Two, you must build a path to reach the Realm of the Gods.  And three, you must have some way of remaining corporeal in that Realm so that you can carry the weapon.

The first is easy enough. The \iScythe{} is one of the \pFarm{} Relics that can be used for the Ritual to control the Storm. Normally it is stored in the Library of the College, and is only accessible at the Time of Deciding. Here on the island, so close to the building storm, the Relics absorb magical energy and become highly charged, allowing them to do things that would be impossible at other times. The \iScythe{} in such a state could be used to kill someone without risking retribution from the Gods. It could also be used to best almost any \textbf{thing} -- including the guardian of the fountain. If the \iScythe{} is used in the ritual, though, its power will be drained. Therefore, you must either ensure that the \iPitcher{} is used in the ritual instead so that you may take the charged \iScythe{} for yourself, or you must complete your quest before the Ritual is executed.

The second part of your plan is the most uncertain. The Gods themselves supposedly severed the connections between their world and yours. Forging a new path will be difficult. But here at the \pSc{} are some of the best minds in all of \pEarth{} -- and you have reason to suspect that the answer is closer to home than you could ever have imagined. Your little birdies recently intercepted letters suggesting that \cCurse{\full}, one of the other \pFarm{} advisors, is working on a secret project that could allow access to the Realm of the Gods. \cCurse{} is about as powerful as a \emph{commoner} can get, and while you are loath to rely on \cCurse{\them} more than you must, if \cCurse{\they} \cCurse{\have} the key to reaching the realm of the Gods, then you are more than willing to hold your nose and work with \cCurse{\them} to see your plans come to fruition. 

The third part of your plan took a lot of digging (some of it literal), but you have a solution. Most records of the \cDisneySect{} were burned, not long after they were. The \cDisneySect{} were a small cult of \cFarmGod{} clerics who were researching some exceedingly esoteric things, including something akin to astral projection. Unfortunately for you, the sect was destroyed in a decisive strike by the mainstream church some 200 years ago and their knowledge almost lost. Over painstaking years, you pieced together the story of a person in a glass box under an enchanted sleep – a living repository of knowledge, just waiting to be found and awakened. Nine months ago, you finally found \cDisney{\them} under the very roots of the \pSpine{}. It was simple enough to break the spell; it was a good curse, but an old one that had never been renewed. 

The awakened sleeper, named \cDisney{\full}, was quite disoriented in this new world, and you have been serving as a mentor and supporter. It was your influence that got \cDisney{} a place at the \pSchool{}. \cDisney{\They} \cDisney{\are} a sweet, naive \cDisney{\child}, so much so that interacting with \cDisney{\them} sets your teeth on edge. Still, you must continue the charade of a generous benefactor for now. It is a charade, right? You aren’t actually starting to develop parental feelings towards \cDisney{}, are you? Ahem. As part of the charade, you must do a certain amount of politicking to make sure that the relevant teachers and advisors are ranking \cDisney{} as their top choice for voting authority. Making grand, public gestures to remind \cDisney{} that you are on \cDisney{\their} side is important for the optics. You must gain \cDisney{\their} trust and persuade \cDisney{\them} to share with you the secrets of the \cDisneySect{}, and the ritual that would allow you to have a physical form in the Realm of the Gods. You suspect \cDisney{\theyare} reluctant to share the ritual since it was this very knowledge that prompted the church to destroy them 200 years ago. So you have been cautious, and have not asked them directly yet. Instead, you found \cDisney{\them} a ``friend'' to do it for you, another student named \cPirateChild{\full}. If \cPirateChild{} proves incompetent, though, you may need to ask \cDisney{} yourself.

You met \cPirateChild{} during your travels in the coastlands of the \pFarm{}. The pirate ship the Silent Fog was extorting ``protection'' money from the locals, and \cPirateChild{}  was aboard. You offered to bankroll \cPirateChild{}'s attendance at the College of the Gods in exchange for \cPirateChild{\their} help in getting the information you need from \cDisney{}. \cPirateChild{} is a convenient pawn and a potential scapegoat if \cDisney{} takes the prying the wrong way. Moreover, the blackmail you have on \cPirateChild{} – that \cPirateChild{\they} is a pirate from the infamous Silent Fog – is more than enough to ensure \cPirateChild{\their} cooperation.

If people knew your real agenda, they would probably call you selfish, but your interest in the Gods goes back to long before you realized that Immortality was in your grasp. People tend to talk about the four Patron Deities like they are the only Deities -- but they are not. There are \textbf{many} minor deities, of all kinds of things. One throws salt over one’s shoulder to invoke a minor God of protection and so forth. And the hierarchy of the Gods is not as cemented as they would like mortals to believe. The Gods are \textbf{always} jockeying for position. And people like you know the signs to read. Some minor god is preparing something big. They've been preparing for a long time, amassing followers, and thus power. And you want in on it - as long as it can benefit you. You’ve been seeking out this new Deity's elusive followers for several years now, but to no avail. Something is coming to a head this weekend, and you want to know what -- and how to turn it to your advantage.

You've had a distressingly hard time finding any leads about the followers of the mysterious Fifth God, other than that this group bears the symbol of a \textbf{four-leaf clover} and is based out of the \pShippies{}. After considering your options, you decided to let other people do the work for you. You identified \cBunker{\full} as an individual who seems to know entirely too much about too many things to be \emph{just} an engineer. You suspect that \cBunker{\they} are a spy for the L'eau Spymaster. In which case, if anyone were to have information about these followers of a Fifth God, it would be \cBunker{}. \cDisney{} has always been good at getting into places \cDisney{\they} \cDisney{\does}n’t belong, so you asked \cDisney{\them} to help you get into \cBunker{}’s suitcase. As far as you know, \cDisney{\they} succeeded, so all you need to do is retrieve whatever \cDisney{\they} found.

But pet projects aside, technically you \textbf{are} here as an advisor. Your job is to support \cEvil{} at the bargaining table while the other advisors try to arrange a ceasefire or something. Frankly, you’d rather the peace talks failed and the war continue. War is good for business. Your family’s lands are lucratively positioned between the fertile farmlands of the \cChupStudent{\formal} family, the coastal plains of the \cWildCard{\formal} family, and the border with the \pTech{} — importing weapons and exporting food fills your coffers. And for you personally, the war distracts the Deities, meaning no one is looking too closely at what you are doing. For surely the Gods would stop you if they knew you were after something as uniquely divine as immortality. The morality of indirectly hurting or killing the idiots that started the war (the \pShip{}) doesn’t particularly concern you.

Still, an advisor must always be apprised of the current political situation, and in the viper's nest of Court in the \pFarm{}, a single wrong phrase could end a career. Knowledge is power, whether it be blackmail, favors owed, or even just the right tidbit of gossip, and you intend to accumulate as much of it as you can this weekend. One thing you recently learned is that \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{} favors \cQueen{\their} \textbf{youngest} \cPrince{\child}, \cPrince{} as \cQueen{\their} heir. Now your family has never fallen over themselves to fawn at the \cQueen{\Majesty}’s feet, and one of the \cQueen{\Majesty}’s other children might be a softer touch (leaving more power for your family to amass), but \cPrince{} might also prove to be a valuable ally. Either way, something was supposed to happen a month ago. \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{} sent \cPrince{} to visit Duke \cChupStudent{\formal}. You held your breath to see where the chips would fall. None fell. Something went wrong. With the idle curiosity of one whose life could soon depend on it, you’d dearly love to know what.

One good thing that’s come out of being apprised of politics is the friend you found in \cHedonist{\full}. You met \cHedonist{} through other contacts while you were looking to buy intelligence on the inner workings of the court. What started as a professional business meeting unexpectedly turned into a drinking party -- and you suddenly found yourself with a drinking buddy whose presence you enjoyed. Through some twist of luck, it turns out that \cHedonist{} will be here at the \pSc{} this weekend as well, in \cHedonist{\their} capacity as a \cHedonist{\cleric}. You’d like to take the chance to sneak away from all this stress for a bit and catch up if you can.

This weekend the goal of Immortality, something you’ve worked toward for many years, is within your grasp. Shake hands with him, charm her, and it’ll be yours. You just gotta make sure whatever the new God has planned isn’t going to screw with \emph{your} plans, and survive whatever political machinations are afoot. But you intend to keep an open mind. Either of these uncertainties could be an advantage for you to capitalize on.


\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Partake of the ambrosia of the Gods to become immortal. To do this, you will need to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Convince \cDisney{} to teach you the ritual to be able to be corporeal in the Divine Realm, or lean on \cPirateChild{} to learn the ritual from \cDisney{\them} for you. To that end, convince the appropriate advisors to rank \cDisney{} highest for voting authority, and make sure \cDisney{} knows how much you are doing for \cDisney{\them}.
		\item Find a way to reach the Realm of the Gods. Maybe \cCurse{} can help, though you are loath to let such an important plan hinge on the services of a commoner, and expect to need to remain heavily involved to ensure its success.
		\item Bring the \iScythe{} with you to slay the guardian (it must be attuned to the \pFarm{} to be useful to you).
	\end{itemize}
	\item Decide where you stand with \cPrince{} and support or hinder \cPrince{\them} as you deem appropriate.
	\item Figure out what this new Fifth God is planning. Their followers on \pEarth{} are probably your best lead. You just have to find them.
	\item Accumulate as much information and other resources as you can via the black market, or other means at your disposal, for the purposes of trading it away for immediate favors or hoarding it as an insurance policy.
	\item Look after the interests of the \pFarm{} – prevent a peace treaty or ceasefire from being reached, and make sure the Storm does not get sent to your homeland.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item This is your first time as an Advisor at the College of the Gods. You had to work hard to get here, though discovering \cDisney{} certainly helped smooth your way.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cDisney{}} An 18 year old \cDisney{\child} you awoke from a magical slumber. \cDisney{\They} \cDisney{\have} a secret you need, and you may or may not be developing some parental feelings towards \cDisney{\them}.
	\contact{\cEvil{}} The head of the \pFarm{} delegation; you are supposed to be \cEvil{\their} second at the negotiating table, but you expect to be quite busy with your other plans.
	\contact{\cCurse{}} A \emph{commoner}, but one who may have a way to reach the Realm of the Gods.
	\contact{\cPrince{}} The youngest \cPrince{\child} of \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{}. \cPrince{} has designs on the throne and you haven’t made your mind up yet whether you support \cPrince{\their} bid.
	\contact{\cHedonist{}} Your \cHedonist{\cleric} drinking buddy you met while gathering information on the court. Might even turn out to be useful.
	\contact{\cPirateChild{}} The pirate \cPirateChild{\kid} from The Silent Fog whom you have recruited to be your cat’s paw in persuading \cDisney{} to teach you the ritual to be corporeal in the Divine Realm.
	\contact{\cBunker{}} The L’eau engineer charged with maintaining the school’s magical bunkers, whom you suspect of being a spy. You had \cDisney{} steal notes from \cBunker{\them} to see what you could learn.
\end{contacts}
