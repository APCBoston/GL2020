%%Chris AKA Chris Chelberg AKA FPF Teacher ChupInventor

You are \cChupInventor{\full} (\cChupInventor{\they}/\cChupInventor{\them}) -- brilliant 55 year-old inventor and Diplomacy and Political Science Teacher at the \pSchool{} -- but most importantly, a Bishop of the \pGoaties{}. You have channeled all of your rage against your home country, the \pTech{}, into ever more fervor for your God, \cGenesis{}. This weekend is the culmination of almost a decade of work in the shadows -- and you don’t intend to let this chance pass you by.

You’ve known that inventing was in your blood since you were young. As a citizen of \pTech{}, however poor, your parents encouraged your passion from day 1. As you grew your confidence did also, as your inventions became more impressive and practical. You went from inventing magic propelled paper airplanes to a machine that could measure weight to a fraction of an ounce. Until finally, you had completed your magnum opus -- a new type of magical food preservation that could revolutionize your country. The power of these ``refrigeration coils’’ could not be overstated. While magically intensive, if you could leverage the massive industrial potential of the \pTech{}, it would be a practical solution to your country’s food circulation problems. Understanding all of this, you were of course excited to share your invention with the world -- and to receive the proper adulation for your hard work. Unfortunately, that all came crashing down in an instant.

With the support and encouragement of your best friend \cHeadScientist{}, you submitted your invention to be considered for production to the Temple -- just as all inventors are required to. You’d never considered one of your previous inventions to be enough, so despite your prolific inventing, this was your first time here. As the door opened, you looked up with confidence as the \cAntiChup{\cleric} approached you -- only to deliver the devastating news that your invention was rejected. Not rejected for revisions -- rejected outright, because it was too ``expensive’’ to put into production. 

You don’t remember the next moments. Later, people were telling you that you were kicked out of the Temple after you tried to attack the \cAntiChup{\cleric}. That didn’t sound like you, but then again, neither did failure. When you came back to yourself, though, you were faced with the cold hard reality that not only had your best work been rejected, but you had been banned from ever setting foot in the Temple again.

You were almost destroyed by this news. Your very reason for existence was being denied -- for no good reason. That short-sighted \cAntiChup{\cleric}, \cAntiChup{} couldn’t see how much time and money and effort would be saved by your invention. The only reason you could think of to reject your invention was simple classism -- you came from a poor family, and apparently those with a higher status wanted to keep you that way. Two months later, your suspicions were validated. An invention very similar to yours but with even less efficiency and a smaller capacity was greenlit. The only thing this invention had going for it over yours was that it was invented by the daughter of a Council Member. It was class warfare in its most distilled form. And this news was what broke you.

The next few years were spent in a dark cycle of rage and regret. You built things, then destroyed them, got jobs, then quit after the first annoyance. Your whole worldview had been torn down, and you didn’t know how to cope -- so you spun your wheels. That was, until 8 years ago when emph{\cChupLeader{\they}} came along to give you a second chance -- the founder of the \pGoaties{}, \cChupLeader{}. It didn’t take much to convince you to renounce \cTechGod{} and \cTechGod{\their} entire structure that handed power only to the lucky few. \cGenesis{}’s message of true equality for all resonated with you strongly, and you believed in \cChupLeader{}’s ability to bring that vision to life. 

It was with great fervor that you helped build the \pGoaties{}. You were only too happy to lie, cheat, and steal your way up the ranks through the society that had wronged you. You did a lot of good for the group in your position as a diplomat, feeding information and covering for the budding black market. With them, unlike in your inventing career, your efforts were quickly recognized. In just 2 short years, you were named the Bishop representing the \pTech{}. With this new position came a new charter -- infiltrate the \pSchool{}, assist with the administration of the black market operations there, and await the time to implement your leader’s masterstroke -- whatever that might be. You studied hard and obtained the qualifications necessary to become a teacher in less than a year. After that, with the resources of the cult at your back, it was a simple matter to get the job of Diplomacy and Political Science teacher at the \pSc{} just weeks before the Storm six years ago.

You’ve been working towards this moment all this time. Finally, this weekend, all the pieces are in place to execute your masterstroke, and finally reveal the \pGoaties{} to the world. To that end, the \pGoaties{} have produced a Relic that, if used in the Ritual, will target the Storm to the \pSchool{} -- and in doing so, destroy it utterly. Destroying the \pSc{} would not only serve as a powerful symbol that a new Deity has entered the pantheon, but also an assassination on many powerful people in all three nations. To achieve this result, you must either install the relic you have constructed, or corrupt one of the existing relics in order to cause it to be attuned to the \pSc{} instead of it’s home nation.

While this is your most crucial goal by far, you have a lot more to keep you busy this weekend. You have been heavily involved in the black market since its inception and are the head of the \pTech{} arm of the organization. You have been using your position to undermine the intellectual property laws of the \pTech{} as hard as you could out of spite. Your main contact in this is \cChupSecond{}, another teacher at the \pSc{}. \cChupSecond{} is the efficient and competent administrator of the black market and the second in command of the \pGoaties{} as a whole. You’ve enjoyed working with \cChupSecond{} and sometimes wondered if the \pGoaties{} would be better off with \cChupSecond{} at the helm -- but your current leader, the charismatic and bold \cChupLeader{}, has \cChupLeader{\their} own benefits as well. At any rate, your duties to the black market this weekend are simple -- buy, sell, or steal as much valuable information and as many goods as you can, and keep the money flowing.

As the black market liason for the entire FPF, you've handled many unique and fascinating items over the years. Most of these things come from your contacts in the \pTech{} or directly from \cChupSecond{}. Recently you have sold such things as a mechanical bird to a representative of the \cQueen{}, a full wedding party’s worth of Tech clothing to a fleet in \pShip{}, and a beautiful ring to a person named \cHedonist{}, who is actually here as an advisor this weekend. Your main export, though, has always been your personally developed technology, especially your refrigeration tech. To circumvent \cTechGod{}’s laws on activating your own technology, you have been using a set of magical stones that store power. These stones are crucial to your work, and are fading in power -- but you aren’t particularly concerned. After all, once \cGenesis{} rises to power, you will no longer have to hide from \cTechGod{}’s wrath and can sell all of the tech you like.

The supplier for your all important magical stones was actually someone that was extremely important to you -- one of your few childhood friends and the only one you’ve kept in touch with, \cHeadScientist{}. \cHeadScientist{} was your most trustworthy ally before your life changed and is coming to the school as an advisor this weekend. As close as you are, you haven’t had much chance to meet -- you’ve been busy working with the \pGoaties{} and \cHeadScientist{\they} \cHeadScientist{\have} been just as busy with \cHeadScientist{\their} work. Having the chance to meet in person is an unexpected blessing -- but also a burden, as the plan is to destroy the school and everyone in it. You \emph{must} find a way to get \cHeadScientist{} out of harm’s way, as seeing \cHeadScientist{\them} hurt would leave an extremely sour taste in your mouth. One way to protect \cHeadScientist{\them} would be to bring \cHeadScientist{\them} into the fold, as one of the \pGoaties{}, but it’s by no means the only way.

Your last bit of business this weekend is also somewhat personal. You checked the guest list, then did a double take when you noticed the name of one of the advisors from \pTech{}. \cAntiChup{}. The very \cAntiChup{\cleric} who denied your invention all those years ago -- and a name you will never forget. You have long wondered what you would do if given the opportunity to have your revenge -- and at long last, you have the means to do so. Killing \cAntiChup{} outright wouldn’t do -- though you won’t object if \cAntiChup{\they} happened to perish in the attack on the \pSc{}. No, you need to expose \cAntiChup{\them} for what \cAntiChup{\they} truly \cAntiChup{\are} -- and destroy the position that \cAntiChup{\they} used against you so long ago. \cAntiChup{} has surely committed more evil in the time you’ve been away, but prying those secrets from \cAntiChup{\them} won’t be easy. Perhaps the easier way to strike at \cAntiChup{\them} is through manipulating those around \cAntiChup{\them} -- a person as vile as \cAntiChup{} can’t have TRUE friends.

This weekend will be busy. You hope to find some personal time to save a friend and to extract your revenge. But above all else, you need to make sure that your work for the last decade comes to fruition. You will not let the status quo beat you down again. 

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Ensure the \pGoaties{}’ plan to destroy the school and elevate \cGenesis{} to the rank of Patron God goes off without a hitch. This will require incorporating a relic attuned to the school into the ritual.
	\item Run the black market, together with \cChupSecond{}
	\item Decide whether you believe \cChupLeader{} or \cChupSecond{} should lead the \pGoaties{}.
	\item Protect and support your best friend, \cHeadScientist{}, no matter what.
	\item Take any opportunity you find to weaken the other Gods and their followers.
