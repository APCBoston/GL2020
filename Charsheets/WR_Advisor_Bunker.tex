\name{\cBunker{}}

You are \cBunker{\full} (\cBunker{\they}/\cBunker{\them}), master engineer. You became a master at a young age -- but by now, you have left that youth far behind. This will be your 6th trip to the \pSchool{}, a trip you have come to make every other storm cycle. The purpose is ostensibly to check the integrity of the Bunkers you helped to create and build, which makes for great cover as the Council of Storm Watcher’s spymaster. Though you spend more time looking over spy reports than drafting blueprints nowadays, you remain one of the best engineers of your generation.It frustrates you that everyone credits \cFlow{} for your incredible work -- if only people were more willing to give credit where it is due!

Sure \cFlow{} is the goddess of beginnings, new things, and growth, but what are these abstract concepts without the application of a human mind? Nothing. You carve \cFlow{\their} symbol on the things you make because you must -- no one would buy from you otherwise -- but it hurts your soul to do it. Humans are more than just pawns of the Gods, and you are more than just an instrument of \cFlow{}.

You grew up in 6th fleet, but went to 3rd fleet academy for their engineering and shipwright curriculum. Math, science, and tactile skills all came easily to you, and you excelled. You flew through your apprenticeship in record time, and were a practicing master architect by age 26. When you were approached about the Bunker Revitalization Project by a \cFlow{} cleric claiming to have been given your name by the \cFlow{\God} \cFlow{\themself}, you gritted your teeth at the saccharine religiousness of it all, but agreed - you’d never get a chance to work on something so important otherwise. 

So you set to work, alongside architects from the other two nations, and soon rebuilt the aging architecture into a set of 3 brand-new magical bunkers, able to withstand the swelling power of the Storm as it swirls about the island on which the \pSchool{} is built. Inside the bunkers, the individuals who must remain at the \pSc{} to execute the Ritual to control the Storm are protected from various unpleasant side-effects, both temporary and permanent, of being exposed to that intense level of magic.

That project brought you international attention, and an unusual degree of ability to pass freely between the three nations. This in turn made you a valuable asset for the spymaster of the \pShip{}, who soon recruited you for various missions. At first you didn’t like all the sneaking around, but you soon fell in love with deciphering enemy messages. After all, what are ciphers if not applied math -- the very language you’ve spoken all your life? The previous spymaster often thanked \cEbb{} for finding someone as good at taking codes apart as you. You just rolled your eyes and kept working.

And so, like clockwork, you return to the \pSchool{} every 6 years. At first it was just to keep an eye on and maintain the project. Once you started spy work in earnest though, it became an important source of information as well.  You even have a birdie established inside the school itself!  While they have been careful to conceal their identity, they have been sending you messages for a couple years now.  A recent message contained information regarding \cHistory{} - apparently he is really buddy buddy with \cQueen{}, the current monarch of the \pFarm{}.  Since the teachers at the school are supposed to maintain neutrality, this information could be useful.  In the wrong (or right) hands, it could end \cHistory{}’s career\ldots  \cHistory{} is a good sort and you don’t think you want to push them to be removed from the school, but this could make very good leverage if needed later on.

All things must come to an end, however. You are feeling the weight of your years -- it is past time you took on an apprentice who can handle one or both sets of duties. Someone quick and clever. Someone young, but committed. Someone who loves building things, and taking them apart, as much as you do. You figure your two best options are \cTechStar{} and \cInitiate{}. \cTechStar{} is from \pTech{}, which is a little disappointing - \cTechStar{\they} would have made a fine shipwright - but no one is perfect. \cTechStar{\They} \cTechStar{\are} quite innovative with technology, and as bold as brass, as evidenced by \cTechStar{\their} writing to you out of the blue to request you bring a modest quantity of several rather hard to come by pieces of technology with you to the school. You were happy to oblige, driven primarily by your curiosity about what \cTechStar{\they} could want the parts for\ldots Of course, to take on your spy work, \cTechStar{} would need to renounce loyalty to \pTech{}, and swear to \pShip{} instead. \emph{sigh} This probably also means forswearing \cTechGod{} for \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}.

\cInitiate{\full} has proved most eager to work with you, and \cInitiate{\they} are \pShip{}, which means \cInitiate{\they} might also be able to take over your spy work -- but your hesitation with \cInitiate{} is that, while \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are} a very clever young \cInitiate{\person}, \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are} also an initiate of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}. You are very concerned that \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are} going to sell \cInitiate{\them}selves entirely short, and give all credit - credit that \cInitiate{\they} earned, and \cInitiate{\they} deserve - to the Goddesses. Of equal risk is that \cInitiate{} finds your religious views intolerable and refuses to work with you. Why does everything in this world come down to religion?

You had actually already picked out a promising apprentice 6 years ago to learn the ins and outs of Bunker maintenance, and introduce to spy work -- but due to the massacre of 6 years ago, well\ldots that didn’t work out. With all of the kids dead, and nothing but questions over how the vote to direct the storm could have gone the way it did, you sulked your way home. You were supposed to be \textbf{good} at your job as spymaster. How could something like this have happened right under your nose without you having nary a whiff of it ahead of time? 

While you immediately put an entire task force on finding out what happened in the wake of the event, you have spent six fruitless years trying to track down what happened. In the end, though, internal political pressure, the start of the war, and what you suspect was a masterfully orchestrated coverup prevented you from finding anything solid beyond the very basic cause of death -- a mass poisoning. More than once you nearly sent your prayers on the wind to the Goddesses. For surely the only way your enemies could elude you so completely would be if they had the support of other deities? But your sensible side prevented you - what could \cEbb{} and \cFlow{} really do anyway? And would your enemies, mass murderers as they are, really have the personal protection of \cTechGod{} or \cFarmGod{}? If all of this were somehow ordained by the Gods, it was above your pay grade, and you frankly wanted nothing more to do with it. But at the same time, it is in your nature to be inquisitive. As you are returning to the \pSchool{} for what may be the last time, maybe, just maybe, you can finally find some answers.

Of more pressing concern to you right now, though, is an imminent threat to the safety of the school and possibly your nation - the \pGoaties{}. When they first appeared on your radar 4 years ago, you didn’t take them too seriously. A fringe group concerned with stirring up trouble among \pEarth{}’s poorest. While you dutifully formed a task force to monitor them, you didn’t give it much if any personal oversight. It was only yesterday that you realized how fatal of a mistake that was. An agent outside of the taskforce personally proved that yesterday’s assassination attempt on \cHeadDiplomat{}, the head diplomat who was meant to meet you at the school as head of the \pShip{} delegation, was the work of a cult assassin. While the assassination attempt failed, the result was almost as bad -- \cHeadDiplomat{} was forced to kill in self-defense, resulting in instant amnesia. Meanwhile, your taskforce’s latest report indicated that the \pGoaties{} were YEARS away from developing the kind of power necessary for that hit. There were no two ways about it -- your taskforce on the \pGoaties{} was clearly compromised. You ordered every agent on it detained for further questioning, and discarded everything you thought you knew about the \pGoaties{} as deliberate misinformation. It was time to start from scratch.

What you could verify with agents you trusted and pull together from other sources on less than a day's notice was sparse -- but it wasn’t nothing. The \pGoaties{} seem to have spread like wildfire since the start of the war, and have become much more powerful than one could reasonably expect in such a short time frame. They even appear to be the hands holding the reins on the black market, a network that runs through \pShip{} and is headquartered at \pSc.  You suspect that means they are backed by a foreign government, but you have no hard evidence of this fact. One suppressed and abandoned report caught your eye in your frantic scramble. This report claims that the true goal of the \pGoaties{} is to eliminate magic from the face of \pEarth{}. While you can see the appeal on the surface, it’s perfectly clear to you as a professional how much death and destruction this would cause, even beyond the evil that must be wrought to get to that point. The last piece of information that you can trust is that the \pGoaties{} seem to want to sabotage the ritual to control the storm somehow. This sabotage will likely center on the relics - but exactly how, you do not know. Could they be trying to create fake relics? Damage or break existing ones? Steal them outright? You have to plan to counter it all. As such, anyone who brings an unknown relic, tries to tamper with an existing one, or even just spends too much time with one is a suspect for being a cultist. And any changes to which relics are scheduled to be used in the ritual for any reason should be met with the utmost scrutiny for potential foul play. You don’t know what they’re up to -- but you do know that they won’t catch you underestimating them again.

The Ritual and the Bunkers aren’t the only thing that needs to be safeguarded at the school. The cluster of leylines that rise from the ground to the sky here, the very reason this island floats, needs maintenance every 3 years as well. Organizing this rather unpleasant task falls to the principal of the school, \cPrincipal{}, and you have come to treat participating in that process as part of your duty whenever you are here.

As much as you disdain religion, and decline spirituality for yourself, it’s clear to you that the priesthood isn’t bad for everyone. Over your last three trips to the school, you have managed to become quite fond of \cPirate{}, one of the \pShip{} teachers who works there. \cPirate{\They} in turn \cPirate{\have} confided to you a rather outlandish dream - \cPirate{} wishes to become a \cPirate{\cleric} of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}. \cPirate{} is a good sort, and you see the peace that comes over \cPirate{\them} when \cPirate{\they} speak in hushed tones about the possibility. If only it hadn’t been 2 centuries since a \cPirate{\person} was a cleric -- and even that was a special exception! Centuries of precedent will be hard to overcome. If it were just \cFlowPriest{} here, \cPirate{} might have had a chance to make this work this weekend -- but unfortunately, \cEbbPriest{} is quite a stickler for the rules.

As for the other teachers, you don’t usually bother getting too close to people from the other nations, unless you are trying to get information out of them. But the curse breaking teacher, \cPrince{} is a rare exception. \cPrince{\They} \cPrince{\are} the \cQueen{\Majesty}’s youngest \cPrince{child}, a shrewd and calculating mind, and your frequent opponent in chess. Normally one would expect the spymaster to prefer the leaders of foreign nations to be not particularly clever. But \cPrince{} is as gregarious and gracious in victory as in defeat - and you’ve never had a finer chess partner. \cPrince{} is \emph{fun} to match wits with. And \cPrince{\they} \cPrince{\have} gone and lost something. Something important. Something you might be able to help them find. Would it be so bad for the head of a foreign nation to owe you a favor or two? If only \cPrince{\they} would tell you what it was \cPrince{\they} lost that is so important to find.

You plan to make this weekend one of uncovering past secrets and preparing for the future. Your job is to protect people, and the \pShip{} at large. There are Bunkers to inspect, a new apprentice to pick and begin training, old mysteries to solve, and a few friends to help out along the way. As long as you don’t smother under all the bowing and scraping to the gods, and no one accuses you of being blasphemous over it, it should be a welcome challenge.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Check the bunkers over carefully throughout the weekend, make sure there is no chance of a catastrophic failure and repair any normal wear and tear you find.
	\item Pick either \cTechStar{} or \cInitiate{} as your apprentice, convince them to agree to it (if necessary) and begin the process of training them to look after the bunkers and take over as spymaster for the \pShippies{}.
	\item Ensure the \iNet{} is used in the Ritual to Control the storm - in general, keep an eye on the relics and investigate anyone suspicious for connection to the \pGoaties{}.
	\item Support \cPirate{} in \cPirate{\their} dream of becoming a \cPirate{\cleric} of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}.
	\item Support \cPrince{} in \cPrince{\their} bid to become the next \cPrince{\Majesty} of \pFarm{}, starting with finding whatever it is \cPrince{\they} lost.
	\item Prevent the \pGoaties{} from sabotaging the Ritual to control the Storm and collect as much reliable intel about the cult as you can.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item 
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cInitiate{}} A young \cInitiate{\person} from \pShip{}. \cInitiate{} is very enthusiastic to learn engineering from you, but \cInitiate{\their} level of commitment to the religion worries you.
	\contact{\cTechStar{}} A young \cTechStar{\person} from \pTech{}. \cTechStar{} is quite the inventor if what you’ve heard from the Tech Star Competition is right, and might make a good apprentice for you, if you could switch \cTechStar{\their} loyalties to the \pShip{}.
	\contact{\cPirate{}} \cPirate{} is an old friend with a secret dream to become a \cPirate{\cleric} of \cEbb{} or \cFlow{}.
	\contact{\cPrince{}} A friend and chess partner who is almost as clever as you, with designs on the \pFarm{} throne. \cPrince{} has lost something important.
\contact{\cPrincipal{}} An old acquaintance originally hailing from \pShip{} (long before your time though). You have helped \cPrincipal{\them} maintain the school for several decades.
	\contact{?} A potential spy or informant from \pFarm{} at \pSc{} - \pFarm{} is too well informed on current events at the school to not have a source of information planted here.  If possible, it would be good to find and neutralize them.
