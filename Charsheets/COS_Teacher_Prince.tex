\name{\cPrince{}}

You are \cPrince{} (\cPrince{\they}/\cPrince{\them}), and 38 years old. You’ve been teaching curse breaking at the \pSchool{} for the past 5 years but have much bigger plans. You are the youngest \cPrince{\child} of \cQueen{\Majesty}, \cQueen{}, ruler of the \pFarm{}. None of your siblings want the throne as badly as you, so you intend to take it -- assuming of course you can remedy your\ldots little mistake.

From a very young age, it was obvious you were your \cQueen{\parent}’s \cPrince{\child}. The royal court of \pFarm{} is a pit of vipers -- something your \cQueen{\parent} encourages. The constant fighting is good for the nobility. It keeps them from thinking of uniting against \cQueen{\them}, and elevates the most devious and ruthless to the top of \cQueen{\their} counsel. You took to the whole thing like a duck to water, while your siblings floundered terribly.  Still, you are the \emph{youngest} of quite a large family, and while your \cQueen{\parent} favors you, \cQueen{\they} cannot declare you the heir-apparent without good cause. While your \cQueen{\parent} worked on the details, you were sent off to teach at the \pSchool{} for a few years. This kept you safe from those clever enough to read the signs but still somehow supporting one of your other siblings. 

At the school, you teach curse breaking. Curses aren’t normally the purview of the nobility -- noble magic (read: powerful magic, valuable magic, useful magic) should be used to imbue the land with fertility so that the crops will grow. After all, without an infusion of magic every spring to both the land and the seeds, the \pFarm{} couldn’t feed even one third of its population, let alone make exports to the \pTech{}. But neither you nor your \cQueen{\parent} are fools. \emph{Protection} from curses is prudent for royalty. And it’s not so hard to prepare them either. You’ve done your share of favors for powerful families to curry favor when the issue at hand was too delicate to go to a commoner for. Most recently you created a bad luck curse that was a particularly clever bit of work -- embedded nigh undetectably in a letter, it wouldn’t trigger until opened by someone of the same flesh and blood as the one who commissioned the piece.

When the \cQueen{\Majesty}’s plan was finally ready, your \cQueen{\parent} called you home, and gave you a task. One month ago, \cQueen{\They} entrusted you with one of the two royal signet rings. The other stays on your \cQueen{\parent}’s finger at all times. It was your task to bring it to Duke \cChupStudent{\formal}, father to \cChupStudent{} and use it to approve some piece of legislation he had drafted. A simple enough task, and one that you were more than capable of -- unless of course, the worst kind of bad luck were to strike. And strike it did. You were waylaid by pirates on your way to your destination, and while you escaped with your life, almost all of your possessions were stolen -- including the ornately carved wooden box in which the ring was kept. Pirates\ldots You thought you hated them before, but now they might have cost you the throne. \emph{Unacceptable}.

For now you’ve managed to forestall your \cQueen{\parent} finding out, but that won’t last much longer. \cQueen{\They} has demanded the signed and stamped document as soon as possible -- and you think you can only hold out until the end of the weekend at latest. You must recover the signet ring somehow, at all costs. You hope that the black market (of which you have heard only rumors) will have some leads. The information won’t come cheaply however, and you are prepared to trade in information and curses as necessary to get what you need.

As long as you are keeping an eye out for the black market, you might as well do as you’ve been asked and keep an eye on \cAdopted{}. \cAdopted{}’s family are staunch supporters of your \cQueen{\parent}, and they have some concerns that their adopted \cAdopted{\child} may be straying from \cAdopted{\their} noble duties. Doing what you can to put \cAdopted{\them} back on the straight and narrow could cement \cAdopted{\formal} support for your bid for the throne.

Speaking of allies, \cAntiChup{} has struck up a correspondence with you, and proven a most unexpected ally. It seems that \cAntiChup{} has quite a bit of ambition of \cAntiChup{\their} own, and wanted your help in aiding \cAntiChup{\their} protege in carrying out a few clandestine tasks relating to the war effort. You have yet to learn the details of those tasks, but they seem to involve an awful lot of curses. In return, \cAntiChup{} has essentially written you a blank check for support in your bid for the \pFarm{} throne. You intend to cash in big this weekend.

Of course, there are a lot of other things you could accomplish that would help your position. You could broker a treaty that ends the war. You’d need to go toe to toe with \cDiplomat{}, who brokered the betrayal of the \pShip{} in the first place, but that just means accomplishing it would be a much more impressive feat. Of course, any such treaty must be sufficiently beneficial to the \pFarm{}, otherwise it won’t count in your favor. You could also bring back one or more sufficiently powerful magical artifacts. The relics are the obvious target, but those will be watched by many people and you are not a particularly accomplished thief. If the opportunity arose to smuggle out a fully charged relic (i.e. one not used for the ritual), you’d probably take it. But with so many skilled magic users around this weekend, you are sure there are other things you could acquire. Any new magical innovation is fair game. If you’ve got the only working copy, so much the better. Come to think of it, \cCurse{} is always working on \emph{something}\ldots if whatever \cCurse{\they} are up to now isn’t likely to explode in your face (never a guarantee with \cCurse{}), it might be ideal.

One thing you never expected to find at the school was romance. But there \cPirate{} was. \cPirate{\They} \cPirate{\are} clever, funny, and reliable, and seeing as \cPirate{\they} hail\cPirate{\plural} from the \pShip{}, \cPirate{\have} no complicated obligations among the \pFarm{} nobility. You’d like very much to take \cPirate{} home with you at the end of all of this and get married.

Amidst all of your personal plans, as a teacher at the \pSc{}, you technically have duties you should see to. Helping \cBunker{} with repairing the magical bunkers is one. This task is at least useful to you -- the royal family back home has a not dissimilar bunker, and knowing the ins and outs would allow you to \emph{exploit} any design flaws, should it prove necessary. Luckily for you, \cBunker{} is a fantastic contact, and a mean chess player. The two of you play every chance you get (which isn’t nearly as often as you’d like)

A far less pleasant task is maintaining the ley lines. This is a task that \cPrincipal{} usually oversees, but has tasked \cBeetle{} with this year. The ritual involves some sort of sacrifice of power on the part of the participants. And you have no interest in losing any of your power. But if the ritual doesn’t happen, the whole island could become unstable. You’ll have to find a tactful way to substitute either a willing or gullible alternate participant. Preferably someone you don’t like.

It’s been five years since you left your home in the royal court of \pFarm{}. Assuming you can reclaim the signet ring, you have a good shot at the throne. But you aren’t one to leave things up to chance -- you’d much rather stack the deck in your favor. By accomplishing everything you set out to, you can seize that advantage. And the icing on your coronation cake will of course be sharing it all with \cPirate{}.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Reclaim your signet ring. Make sure you leave game with it, as you cannot claim the \pFarm{} throne without it.
\item Broker a treaty that ends the war and that favors \pFarm{} as much as possible.
\item Acquire one or more magical artifacts, ideally new inventions for which you have the only prototype. \cCurse{} is a good person to start with.
\item Convince \cPirate{} to come home with you and marry you.
	\item Keep an eye on \cAdopted{}; make sure \cAdopted{\they} \cAdopted{\are} not up to anything inappropriate for a noble, like shirking \cAdopted{\their} duties.
\item Learn as much as you can about how the bunkers work from \cBunker{}. 
\end{itemz}

	\contact{\cPirate{}} Your romantic partner. Clever, witty, and politically neutral -- ideal marriage material.
	\contact{\cAdopted{}} The scion of a family whose support you hope to court
	\contact{\cAntiChup{}} An ally in your bid for the throne from \pTech{}. You supply \cAntiChup{\them} with curses in exchange for massive support in getting the throne.
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} The most accomplished diplomat attending this weekend. Responsible for the deal between the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} that betrayed the \pShip{}.
