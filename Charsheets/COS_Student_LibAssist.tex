\name{\cLibAssist{}}

You are \cLibAssist{} (\cLibAssist{\they}/\cLibAssist{\them}). At 21 years old, you are a second year student at \pSchool{}. You grew up in \pFarm{} as the only child of a barely noble family. Your family is unlanded, and is therefore pushed to the very margins of polite society -- barely better than commoners. Still, your family gives you everything they can and you intend to pay them back by clawing your way to the top -- by any means necessary.

From an early age you learned to calculate your every move for maximum benefit. Making friends was rarely advantageous, so you mostly went it alone. Even when all of your hard work paid off (okay, okay, and a lucky break) and you were selected for a spot at the \pSchool{}, you spent most of your first year in office hours and in the library, studying. You had to be the best student you could be. Yet you kept getting distracted by silly, frivolous things like heraldry. That wasn't going to be on the test, so why couldn't you keep it out of your head? Unfortunately, the \pSc{} has the best of the best of the entire continent, and any such distraction can be fatal to your prospects. You were in the process of struggling to keep your grades up when the Librarian took you under \cLibrarian{\their} wing. At first, you told yourself it was just advantageous to you to buddy up to \cLibrarian{\them} - but time soon led to a real friendship forming instead.

When you came back for your second year, you expected to continue the way you had. You were not prepared for the fierce little ball of energy that was \cAdopted{}. \cAdopted{} is in \cAdopted{\their} first year at the \pSc{} and \cAdopted{\they} are pleasantly similar to you in temperament. \cAdopted{} is also ambitious, although with somewhat different aspirations. The two of you became the best of friends and have hatched more than one Machiavellian plan together to get your way.

\cAdopted{} has been working on a particular scheme recently that you are excited to help with. \cAdopted{} is adopted, the \cAdopted{\child} of farmers, taken away to be raised by a noble family against \cAdopted{\their} will. \cAdopted{\They} \cAdopted{\have} been kept away from \cAdopted{\their} birth family all these years and \cAdopted{\they} resent\cAdopted{\plural} it deeply. The two of you have been working on a curse to put on \cAdopted{}'s dastardly family to teach them a lesson, and it should emph{finally} be ready to cast this weekend.

For purely political gains, you've done your best to cozy up to some of the older students, especially the ones from other nations. The activity sets your teeth on edge, but the investment may be finally paying off. \cPresident{}, the student body president, has asked you to consult on an important investigation. While you're personally rather jealous and upset by \cPresident{}'s ability to goof off constantly and still come out as a top student, the prospect of making an important connection and being involved in important work, especially of a clandestine nature, is both thrilling and of solemn importance to you. Everyone knows that six years ago, the students who stayed for the ritual to control the storm all ended up mysteriously dead. It is of course terribly suspicious -- but in your mind, idle speculation does naught but waste time. However, \cPresident{} has a plan to get \emph{real} answers -- and it's your job to implement it. Above all else, you understand the need to keep the investigation very quiet. Nearly every adult who will be here this weekend was there six years ago, even your friend %\cLibrarian{}% -- meaning the culprit has a good chance of being among you. If you tell the wrong person, they might try to stop you to protect the secret of their involvement -- and who knows what means they might select\ldots{}

Speaking of the Librarian, \cLibrarian{\they} \cLibrarian{\have} been acting really strange the last few weeks. Where \cLibrarian{\they} used to be open and welcoming, \cLibrarian{\they} are suddenly distant and cagey. You've seen them wandering the stacks almost like they were lost. It surprised you how much it pains you to see your friend like this. You haven't worked out the best way to approach \cLibrarian{\them} about all this yet, so you've just been silently covering for \cLibrarian{\them} whenever possible, particularly by helping people find things in the labyrinthian space of the library. As \pEarth{}'s foremost repository of magical items and tomes, it is a surprisingly dangerous place. In fact, the Librarian before \cLibrarian{} was killed on the job by a deteriorated piece of spellwork that backlashed unexpectedly when he tried to move it. You will have to figure out what's going on eventually. You don't like being kept in the dark -- and you haven't quite mastered the depths of the Library yourself.

Knowledge is power. And while the library is full of knowledge, it's mostly \emph{old} knowledge. There is also current knowledge - useful, current information. The kind of information that flows as currency on the black market. Oh yes, you know about the black market that thrives under the very noses of every government on \pEarth{}. You were recruited from a somewhat surprising source, \cEthics{}, the Ethics teacher, but now you run errands for \cEthics{\them} -- primarily to \cChupSecond{}, a teacher who has a reliable connection to the market. You've started to try your own hand at collecting and passing information as another means to claw your way up. Amassing as many secrets about your own nation as possible will give you all kinds of advantages when you get home.

And one day, when your curiosity got the better of you, you opened one of the sealed packets you were carrying to read a message you are sure that neither \cEthics{} nor \cChupSecond{} knows. \cInterpol{}, the brand new Combat teacher, is no teacher at all. \cInterpol{\Their} entire history is fabricated! Put on the trail, you've spied on \cInterpol{} a bit, and are convinced \cInterpol{} is part of some kind of secret government agency. Can you use this to your advantage somehow? You won't know unless you confront them with what you know.

Considering life beyond the \pSc{}, your options seemed limited at first. You couldn't become a Librarian, there's no prestige in that at all -- unless \cLibrarian{} retires, in which case you can take the somewhat prestigious job at the \pSc{}? Maybe you can amass enough information to blackmail someone important enough to get a serious job in the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s court? Or maybe, just maybe, you'll win an internship fair and square. \cEvil{} is a very high ranking advisor of \cQueen{\Majesty} \cQueen{}. \cEvil{\They} wrote to you not long ago, inviting you to compete for the chance to become \cEvil{\their} assistant. That kind of jump in prestige and power is something you could accomplish in \emph{no other way}. If there's a chance for you to win that internship, you will. No, you emph{must}.

You might be thinking about the future, but even so, you've got one more year of school. And while you're here, it would certainly be nice to be the top of the pecking order next year -- in other words, to be voted student body president. Campaigns for that won't start for another few months, but among other things, being chosen to demonstrate your magical prowess as part of the Graduation Ceremony for the third years will give you a boost toward that. You think you have a good shot at being chosen -- if you can cozy up to teacher \cMusic{}, that is.

This weekend is your big shot in a lot of ways, so you can't mess it up. You're going to do your family proud and get the respect and position you deserve. You aren't afraid to break the rules to do it either. A win is a win, after all -- a quick and dirty one counts for just as many points as a clean and fair one. All that matters is that you and your friends come out on top!

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Win \cEvil{}'s apprenticeship
	\item Help \cAdopted{} get revenge on \cAdopted{\their} family.
	\item Figure out what is going on with \cLibrarian{}. Cover for \cLibrarian{} in the meantime by being an indispensable library aid.
	\item Learn what happened to the students six years ago.
	\item Amass as much information (collect information tokens) about \pFarm{} as you can. 
\item Continue to facilitate communication between \cEthics{} and \cChupSecond{} for as long as you find it beneficial to you personally to do so.
	\item See what concessions you can get from \cInterpol{} in exchange for your silence.
	\item Participate in the graduation ceremony as one of the students doing the magical exhibition.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You have a mempacket that says open if you see item number \iSignetRing{\MYnumber}. This represents being able to use your random, obscure knowledge of heraldry to identify the object.
	\item Your extensive time in the library gives you major advantages over others when navigating the library.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cLibrarian{}} A surprisingly good friend among the adults at the school. \cLibrarian{\They} \cLibrarian{\have} been acting really odd lately\ldots
	\contact{\cAdopted{}} Your best friend among the students. \cAdopted{\They} are ambitious and devious and you are happy to help \cAdopted{\them} with \cAdopted{\their} plans as long as \cAdopted{\they} help you with yours in return.
	\contact{\cPresident{}} The current student body president who has asked you to help with \cPresident{\their} investigation.
	\contact{\cEthics{}} The ethics teacher who you often run errands for, including carrying messages and valuable items to and from \cChupSecond{}.
	\contact{\cChupSecond{}} The economics teacher and your connection to the \pEarth{}n black market.
	\contact{\cEvil{}} The \pFarm{} advisor who is offering you the chance to win an internship. It would be a \textbf{huge} jump in status. You must beat the other competitors, fairly or otherwise, and win that internship.
