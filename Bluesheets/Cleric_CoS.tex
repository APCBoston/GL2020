\name{\bCoSCleric{}}

For those who become a Cleric of \cFarmGod{}, the path is full of beauty, wonder, and possibility.  It is an opportunity for those amongst the working class to pursue a life of music, scholarship, or education; and it is an opportunity for the non or less magically gifted children among the nobility to find purpose in life outside of childcare and estate management.

\section{A Cleric's Powers and Responsibilities}
Clerics are expected to be sources of advice and support to their community. They lead rituals to honor \cFarmGod{}. They guide wayward souls back to the path of goodness. They enforce the rules of society, through parables and advice.

\cFarmGod{} grants \cFarmGod{\their} Clerics power in the finely honed musical healing arts.  \pFarm{} Clerics with only rudimentary musical talents find that the songs of healing bloom in their hearts and spill easily from their lips after they dedicate themselves to \cFarmGod{} and accept \cFarmGod{\their} touch.

Those Clerics strongest in the healing arts find that over time they develop almost a prescience when it comes to the health of the community.  They will feel called to walk a certain path, only to come upon someone ill or injured amongst their travel.  Even with magical healing coming so easily, Clerics of \cFarmGod{} make it a habit to always carry at least a rudimentary first aid kit with them wherever they go.

The clergy form the backbone of the \pFarm{} education system for the commoners. The clergy work in tandem with the younger children of noble families who choose to go into education. Education is incredibly important to the \pFarm{} because it is seen as part of taking care of the children.

For those for whom teaching cannot be made to suit, there is the opportunity to become a historian or a researcher. The church of \cFarmGod{} keeps many of the records of the \pFarm{}. If one can earn a spot at one of the research institutions, one can study and research the most esoteric of religious doctrine.

\section*{The Hummingbirds}
Hummingbirds are sacred to \cFarmGod{}. \cFarmGod{\Their} avatars on \pEarth{} are hummingbirds the size of carts. Fewer and fewer of those have been seen in recent decades, and almost none in the past 5 years. Some scholars point to times in history when this has happened, and posit that it is a natural cycle. Others fret that it might be an ill omen of some kind.
