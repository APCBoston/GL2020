%%Chris AKA Chris Chelberg AKA FPF Teacher ChupInventor

You are \cChupInventor{\full} (\cChupInventor{\they}/\cChupInventor{\them}) -- brilliant 55 year-old inventor and Diplomacy and Political Science Teacher at the \pSchool{} -- but most importantly, a Bishop of the \pGoaties{}. You have channeled all of your rage against your home country, the \pTech{}, into ever more fervor for your God, \cGenesis{}. This weekend is the culmination of almost a decade of work in the shadows -- and you don't intend to let this chance pass you by.

You've known that inventing was in your blood since you were young. As a citizen of the \pTech{}, however poor, your parents encouraged your passion from day one. As you grew your confidence did also, as your inventions became more impressive and practical. You went from inventing magic propelled paper airplanes to a machine that could measure weight to a fraction of an ounce. Until finally, you had completed your magnum opus -- a new type of magical food preservation that could revolutionize your country. The power of these ``refrigeration coils'’ could not be overstated. While magically intensive, if you could leverage the massive industrial potential of the \pTech{}, it would be a practical solution to your country's food circulation problems. Understanding all of this, you were of course excited to share your invention with the world -- and to receive the proper adulation for your hard work. Unfortunately, that all came crashing down in an instant.

With the support and encouragement of your childhood best friend \cHeadScientist{\full}, you submitted your invention to be considered for production to the Temple -- just as all inventors are required to. You'd never considered one of your previous inventions to be enough, so despite your prolific inventing, this was your first time here. As the door opened, you looked up with confidence as the \cAntiChup{\cleric} approached you -- only to deliver the devastating news that your invention was rejected. Not rejected for revisions -- rejected outright, because it was too ``expensive'’ to put into production. You don't remember the next moments. Later, people told you that you were kicked out of the Temple after you tried to attack the \cAntiChup{\cleric}. That didn't sound like you, but then again, neither did failure. When you came back to yourself, though, you were faced with the cold hard reality that not only had your best work been rejected, but you had been banned from ever setting foot in the Temple again.

You were almost destroyed by this news. Your very reason for existence was being denied -- for no good reason. That short-sighted \cAntiChup{\cleric}, \cAntiChup{\full} couldn't see how much time and money and effort would be saved by your invention. The only reason you could think of to reject your invention was simple classism -- you came from a poor family, and apparently those with a higher status wanted to keep you that way. Two months later, your suspicions were validated. An invention very similar to yours but with even less efficiency and a smaller capacity was greenlit. The only thing this invention had going for it over yours was that it was invented by the daughter of a Council Member. It was class warfare in its most distilled form. And this news was what broke you.

The next few years were spent in a dark cycle of rage and regret. You built things, then destroyed them, got jobs, then quit after the first annoyance. Your whole worldview had been torn down, and you didn't know how to cope -- so you spun your wheels. That was, until 8 years ago when \emph{\cChupLeader{\they}} came along to give you a second chance -- the founder of the \pGoaties{}, \cChupLeader{\full}. It didn't take much to convince you to renounce \cTechGod{} and \cTechGod{\their} entire structure that handed power only to the lucky few. \cGenesis{}'s message of true equality for all resonated with you strongly, and you believe in \cChupLeader{}'s ability to bring that vision to life. 

It was with great fervor that you helped build the \pGoaties{}. You were only too happy to lie, cheat, and steal your way up the ranks through the society that had wronged you. You did a lot of good for the group in many areas, feeding information and covering for the budding black market. With them, unlike in your inventing career, your efforts were quickly recognized. In just 2 short years, you were named the Bishop representing the \pTech{}. With this new position came a new charter -- infiltrate the \pSchool{}, assist with the administration of the black market operations there, and await the time to implement your leader's masterstroke -- whatever that might be. You studied hard and obtained the qualifications necessary to become a teacher in less than a year. After that, with the resources of the cult at your back, it was a simple matter to spoof the board and get the job of Diplomacy and Political Science teacher at the \pSc{} just months after the Storm six years ago. The death toll of that Storm among the L'eau was a great tragedy, but the ensuing influx of recruits to the Followers of Genesis has been, well, a god-send.

You've been working towards this moment all this time. Finally, this weekend, all the pieces are in place to execute your masterstroke, and finally reveal the \pGoaties{} to the world. To that end, the \pGoaties{} have produced a Relic – the \iHorseshoe{} – that is currently attuned to the \pSchool{}. If the horseshoe, or any other relic attuned to the \pSc{} is used in the Ritual, it will allow the Storm to be targeted at the \pSchool{}, and in doing so, destroy it utterly. Destroying the \pSc{} will not only serve as a powerful symbol that a new Deity has entered the upper echelons of the Pantheon, but also a crushing blow to the current, corrupt political structures of all three nations. To achieve this result, you must either install the Relic you have constructed into the Ritual, or corrupt one of the existing Relics in order to cause it to be attuned to the \pSc{} instead of its home nation. Each Follower of Genesis is playing a part in this plan, and making sure a Relic attuned to the \pSc{} ends up in the Ritual to Control the Storm is yours. You know that others are working on making sure enough votes go to directing the Storm at the \pSc{}, and on sabotaging the Bunkers as a distraction for your enemies from the group's true purpose this weekend. \cChupLeader{} has assured you that as long as the Bunkers are repaired in time, they will protect everyone here from the wrath of the Storm; and even if they are not, the luck of Genesis will still protect you and your fellows.

While installing a Relic attuned to the school in the Ritual to Control the Storm is your most crucial goal by far, you have a lot more to keep you busy this weekend. You have been heavily involved in the black market since its inception and are the head of the \pTech{} arm of the organization. You have been using your position to undermine the intellectual property laws of the \pTech{} as hard as you can out of well justified spite. You source a lot of highly sought after goods, including advanced weaponry. Your main contact in this is \cChupSecond{\full}, a fellow teacher at the \pSc{}. \cChupSecond{} is the efficient and competent administrator of the black market and the second in command of the \pGoaties{} as a whole. \cChupSecond{} thinks \cChupSecond{\theyare} the lynchpin of everything related to the black market, but you're not a bad hand at this yourself. \cGenesis{} forbid something happen to \cChupSecond{}, but if it did, you are more than capable of stepping up and managing the market yourself. Truly, though, you enjoy working with \cChupSecond{}, and sometimes wonder if the \pGoaties{} would be better off with \cChupSecond{} at the helm. \cChupSecond{} \textbf{is} efficient and competent, but \cChupSecond{\theyare} also risk averse; always choosing the sure path. Your current leader, the charismatic and bold \cChupLeader{}, has \cChupLeader{\their} own benefits as well. \cChupLeader{} could charm fire off the coals. It's part of \cChupLeader{\their} brand of magic that \cChupLeader{\they} is very hard to resist when \cChupLeader{\they} is trying to be persuasive. At any rate, your duties to the black market this weekend are simple -- buy, sell, or steal as much valuable information and as many goods as you can. 

As the black market liason for the entire \pTech{}, you've handled many unique and fascinating items over the years. Most of these things come from your contacts in the \pTech{} or directly from \cChupSecond{}, who sources them from the L'eau. Recently you have sold such things as a mechanical bird to a representative of the \cQueen{\Majesty} of the \pFarm{} and a full wedding party's worth of Tech clothing to a fleet in the \pShip{}. \cHedonist{\full}, a \cHedonist{\cleric} from the \pFarm{} is one of your best, repeat customers. Your best export has always been your personally developed technology, especially your refrigeration tech. 

To circumvent \cTechGod{}'s laws on activating your own technology, you have been using a set of magical stones that store power, and the skills that \cGenesis{} taught you. These stones are highly illegal all over Cengea, but especially in the Free People's Federation. You have no idea how \cHeadScientist{} got \cHeadScientist{\their} hands on them, but they are the kindest gift anyone has ever given you. You intend to keep them very secret to protect both of you. Okay, maybe you have some idea how \cHeadScientist{} got \cHeadScientist{\their} hands on the stones. You can't help but notice that they look a lot like the official voting stones for directing the Storm, and that the Time of Deciding treaty was broken the year \cHeadScientist{} gave them to you. But it's best not to look a gift horse in the mouth, and the less you know, the less trouble you can get in if anyone does find out about them. Regardless, the stones are crucial to your work, but are fading in power – you can still use them for small charges of magical energy, but nothing as grand as when you first got them. You aren't particularly concerned, though. Once \cGenesis{} rises to power, you will no longer have to hide from \cTechGod{}'s wrath and can activate and sell all of the tech you like.

\cHeadScientist{} was one of your few childhood friends, and the only one you've kept in touch with. \cHeadScientist{\They} \cHeadScientist{\were} your most trustworthy ally before your life changed, and \cHeadScientist{\theyare} coming to the school as an advisor this weekend. As close as you are, you haven't had much chance to meet -- you've been busy working with the \pGoaties{} and \cHeadScientist{\they} \cHeadScientist{\have} been just as busy with \cHeadScientist{\their} work. Having the chance to meet in person is an unexpected blessing, but also a burden — what if the Bunkers aren't fixed in time and \cHeadScientist{} is killed by the Storm? You would never be able to live with yourself. You \emph{must} find a way to get \cHeadScientist{} out of harm's way. The easiest way to protect \cHeadScientist{\them} would be to bring \cHeadScientist{\them} into the fold, as one of the \pGoaties{}.

Your last bit of business this weekend is also somewhat personal. You checked the guest list, then did a double take when you noticed the name of one of the advisors from the \pTech{}: \cAntiChup{\full}. The very \cAntiChup{\cleric} who denied your invention all those years ago -- and a name you will never forget. You have long wondered what you would do if given the opportunity to have your revenge -- and at long last, you have the means to do so. Killing \cAntiChup{} outright wouldn't do -- that would cost you all your memories and accumulated knowledge. No, you need to expose \cAntiChup{\them} for what \cAntiChup{\they} truly \cAntiChup{\are} -- and destroy the position that \cAntiChup{\they} used against you so long ago. \cAntiChup{} has surely committed more evil in the time you've been away, but prying those secrets from \cAntiChup{\them} won't be easy. Perhaps the easier way to strike at \cAntiChup{\them} is through manipulating those around \cAntiChup{\them} -- a person as vile as \cAntiChup{} can't have TRUE friends. \cAntiChup{} has an apprentice named \cScholarship{\full} whom \cAntiChup{\they} no doubt sorely mistreats. If you can use \cScholarship{\them} against \cAntiChup{\them} in some way, that would be sweet revenge.

This weekend will be busy. You hope to find some personal time to save a friend and to extract your revenge. But above all else, you need to make sure that your work for the last 8 years comes to fruition. You will not let the cruel, utterly unfair status quo beat you down again. 

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Ensure the \pGoaties{}' plan to destroy the school and elevate \cGenesis{} to the rank of Patron God goes off without a hitch. This will require incorporating a Relic attuned to the school into the Ritual to Control the Storm.
	\item Protect and support your best friend, \cHeadScientist{}.
	\item Get revenge on \cAntiChup{} any way you can; convincing \cAntiChup{\their} apprentice \cScholarship{} to betray \cAntiChup{\them} might be a good angle.
	\item Run the black market, together with \cChupSecond{}
	\item Decide whether you believe \cChupLeader{} is the right leader for the \pGoaties{}, and if not \cChupLeader{\them}, then who?
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You teach Diplomacy and Political Science at the \pSchool{}.
	\item You have been teaching at the \pSc{} for five years, and so were not present for the mysterious deaths of twelve students at the Time of Deciding six years ago. You began teaching around the same time as \cPrince{}  and \cChupSecond{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cHeadScientist{}} Your best friend and a brilliant scientist. \cHeadScientist{\They} \cHeadScientist{\are} giving an important presentation this weekend on how to end the Storms permanently.
	\contact{\cChupLeader{}} The charismatic and inspiring leader of the \pGoaties{}. You have followed \cChupLeader{\them} for eight years, and \cChupLeader{\they} \cChupLeader{\have} yet to steer you wrong.
	\contact{\cChupSecond{}} The incredibly organized and competent second in command of the \pGoaties{}. The two of you have run the black market together for several years. \cChupSecond{\Theyare} a little risk-averse though.
	\contact{\cChupStudent{}} is the youngest Follower of Genesis present, a student at the \pSc{}. \cChupStudent{\They} seem\cChupStudent{\plural} loyal enough, and \cChupStudent{\are} charged with earning and manipulating enough votes to direct the Storm at the school. You hope \cChupStudent{\theyare} up to the challenge.
	\contact{\cAntiChup{}} Your worst enemy. \cAntiChup{\They} denied your most brilliant invention many years ago, only to approve a worse version from someone with higher social status. Perhaps you owe them a debt for opening your eyes to just how messed up the world is, but you still intend to extract your revenge.
\contact{\cHedonist{}} A \pFarm{} advisor who has in the past sourced expensive luxury items through your black market link.
