%%Ross Cheung AKA WR Student President

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

You are \cPresident{} (\cPresident{\they}/\cPresident{\them}), and a student at \pSchool{}. You are 17 years old, the Student Body President, and it is your (self appointed) job to keep your fellow students safe when the adults won't. You are from \pShip{}, and primarily follow the teachings of \cEbb{\full}. Ebb's focus on selective pruning of things dead or no longer needed, providing answers and closure, and paving the way for new things drives you.

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

You were born in the 2nd fleet, and grew up with \cInitiate{}, your best friend. The two of you did everything together, except go to academy - you went to 2nd fleet academy, which focused on politics, negotiation, and economic management. You hoped to follow in your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}'s footsteps and become a politician. The war breaking out in your 5th year of schooling only served to emphasize the need for diplomatic solutions that never-the-less .

At \pCollege{}, your background

%%Spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the character's current life, problems, and priorities. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life. Current life and situation.   What they think about the most important contacts

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.

\textbf{Primary Plots:}

(3) The Net of Two Phases (Ebb's relic)  - wants this relic to be used in the ritual because Balance; used the Hallowed Chalice (Flow's relic) last time.

(4) Preparing the Ritual - Care about getting it right for the sake of the Leau. If the ritual is tampered with, it might go even more poorly for us. Also class president responsibility.

(5) What happened to the students? - Wants to find out what happened. A student of Ebb, destruction should be to some purpose - something this big can’t have been the work of 1; and the Gods probably only punished the people who directly executed the attack. Need to find who else masterminded it and bring them to justice.

(12) Covering for a Murderer - Related to the missing diplomat. You were so looking forward to seeing your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}. Why aren't they here? what happened to \cHeadDiplomat{\them}

(31) Ew, Not them! - crushing on \cHeir{} and \cChupStudent{}. with \cInitiate{}'s help, you want to find out if 1) they are willing to poly. 2) can find some work around for the whole war thing.

\textbf{Secondary Plots:}

(13) Librarian’s Amnesia - As student body president, interacts with the faculty more than most. \cLibrarian{} is acting weird - suspect amnesia (that's BAD! who did they kill?!!)

(18) David/Rebecca - \cIntiate{} is your best friend. Must make helping! weird curse thingy, family in CoS... how can I support you?

(36) The Ley Lines - responsibility to help keep the school running.
