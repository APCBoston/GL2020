\name{\gWeekendSchedule{}}

Below is the full event schedule, including both in game and out of game activities as of 5Feb2022. No IC events are mandatory for players to attend. They are probably good places to find other characters, or good times to sneak off and do something secret. The Pre-Game OOC events \textbf{are} mandatory, for the safety and coherence of the event. Post-game OOC events are optional, however, since these activities affect when carpools can leave, players should plan to be on site until 5 pm on Sunday, even if they personally wish to opt out of post game workshops.

Meals on Friday are OOC, as both occur before the game begins. Time to mingle and socialize as players is important for building rapport that facilitates intense play. All meals on Saturday and Sunday are optionally in character for soft RP, or OOC, as players choose. We will designate spaces for IC and OOC in the dining hall.

Quiet hours start at 10 pm each night. Starting at this time, please keep noise from ongoing game activities quiet. No shouting or we’ll get in trouble with the venue. Please respect players who wish to go to sleep, and move game play outside, or to other areas when necessary. The GM HQ will also close at this time so GMs can go to bed or circulate for late night shenanigans. If you need something game related, it will have to wait till morning.

This schedule is subject to change between now and game start as in and out of game needs mandate. We will have a final copy of the schedule at game, which will supersede this one if any changes are made.

%%%%%%%% Meal times: 8 am, 12 pm, 5:30 pm

For workshops on Friday afternoon, you should plan the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pack a jacket and sunscreen in an easily accessible place, we will be outside the whole time, and you may want to grab one or both.
	\item Bring camp chairs or similar if you have them, workshops and orientation are almost 4 hours, and that is a very long time to be on your feet. Even if you don’t need them, or need them the whole time, someone else may benefit greatly from borrowing them.
\end{itemize}
