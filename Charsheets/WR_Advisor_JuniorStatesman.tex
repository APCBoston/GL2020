\name{\cJuniorStatesman{}}

You are \cJuniorStatesman{\full} (\cJuniorStatesman{\they}/\cJuniorStatesman{\them}), and 29 years old. You are an advisor from \pShip{}, and while you weren’t expecting to be in charge, you feel surprisingly ready for the challenge. Your patron deities \cEbb{} and \cFlow{} are the Goddesses of balance - and time is a key element in creating that balance. Wrongs of the past can, and must, be righted in the present. The Treaty, the Storm, and the Avatars of the Gods are all just tools to accomplish that ultimate goal. It is your job as a diplomat to see the bigger picture, and to make the best use of the tools available to you - even in the face of those that cannot see that the ends justify those means. This weekend is going to be a big turning point for you and your country - you’ll make sure of that.

As a child, you attended 2nd Fleet academy in order to study politics, and have since spent most of your adult life working under \cHeadDiplomat{}. \cHeadDiplomat{\Theyare} one of the foremost diplomats of \pShip{}, and a damn good one. You have seen \cHeadDiplomat{\them} broker compromises from impossible situations in the span of an hour, and no problem was ever too big or too small for \cHeadDiplomat{\their} personal attention. While you could never fully fill those gigantic shoes, you have done your best to learn everything you possibly could from \cHeadDiplomat{\them}. This weekend was supposed to  be the culmination of your 7 year apprenticeship, and your graduation from journeyman to master in your own right. But now \cHeadDiplomat{} has lost \cHeadDiplomat{their} memories, and \cEbbPriest{} is in charge. 

You woke up to the dreadful news only yesterday, with a messenger boy pounding on your door. Everything happened so fast after that. A \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{} was called, who quickly took over the situation, confining you and \cChupLeader{}, \cHeadDiplomat{}’s secretary, while \cEbbPriest{\they} ``investigated’’. Hours later, \cEbbPriest{} debriefed you, explaining that \cHeadDiplomat{} had apparently emph{killed someone}, and had \cHeadDiplomat{\their} memories promptly wiped by the Gods. You could hardly believe your ears! \cHeadDiplomat{} was always so mild-mannered, kind, and patient. What possible reason could \cHeadDiplomat{\they} have had to kill someone? But the proof was there right in front of you - missing memories, and a bloody knife in a corpse.

\cEbbPriest{} thought the answer was obvious -- \cHeadDiplomat{} was trying to broker a peace treaty to end the war between the nations. Someone, from which nation was anyone’s guess, must sent the assassin in order to stop that. While the answer was easy and convincing enough on its face, somehow it didn’t sit quite right with you. It was\ldots \textbf{too} easy. Seven years at \cHeadDiplomat{}’s side has taught you that the easy answer is rarely the right one when international politics are involved.

Still, someone had to show up at the \pSchool{} and make sure \pTech{} and \pFarm{} didn’t continue to ride roughshod over \pShip{}. So \cEbbPriest{} packed up you and  \cChupLeader{}, and met up with \cBunker{}, who is blissfully unaware of anything unusual going on. The story that the group is supposed to tell is that \cHeadDiplomat{} became dreadfully ill last night, and couldn’t make it. But in general, the fewer details spread around, the better - all questions are to be turned aside, or directed to \cEbbPriest{}. \cEbbPriest{\They} think \cEbbPriest{they} \cEbbPriest{\have} this all under control. You aren’t so sure about that.

Now that you’re here and not standing directly in your mentor’s shadow, you’re going to conduct yourself a little differently than your amnesiac mentor would have. While you have a lot of respect for \cHeadDiplomat{} and \cHeadDiplomat{\their} strength of character, you feel the call of the Goddesses’ balance leads you on a different path. You strongly believe that your country should extract as much worth as you can from the unjust aggressors from the mainland before signing away your rights to make war. Whether or not the other side acknowledges it, this war is firmly in your favor - so the calls for peace between your nations are premature at best. Unless you.can extract a large stable of concessions from \pTech{} and \pFarm{}, you are firmly against anything stronger than a ceasefire - and only then to give a temporary respite in order to gather your strength for a crushing blow.

Unfortunately, your direct control over that situation is limited at the moment. You were supposed to sit at the bargaining table at \cHeadDiplomat{}’s right hand -- but that all went up in smoke when \cEbbPriest{} took over. \cEbbPriest{} has declared that \cEbbPriest{\they} will handle the treaty negotiations personally, and unfortunately, \cEbbPriest{\their} age and rank make \cEbbPriest{\them} your superior. As much as it rubs you the wrong way, you are not in a position to complain -- and the work you’ve gotten in return is important as well. As it stands, you’ve been redirected, at least for the moment, to heading up the Advisors’ rankings for voting authority, and towards overseeing the Ritual to control the Storm, at least as far as the \pShip{} advisors are concerned. 

You don’t know much about the details of the ritual itself, but you do know that the Relics are incredibly powerful artifacts, to be guarded with the utmost care. The best chance someone would have to steal them would be right now, when they are out and about for the ritual. It is your duty to see to it that no relic leaves the island save for in the proper hands, at the end of the weekend.

Ensuring that the storm is sent somewhere other than \pShip{} is an even more important and difficult task. There are so many variables to how the situation will go, and as the apprentice of \cHeadDiplomat{}, you intend to navigate this situation to a satisfactory conclusion. To that end, you have been keeping your eye out for the best student to back from the \pShip{} -- and you think you’ve picked a winner. \cHeadDiplomat{} has always been fond of \cHeadDiplomat{\their} \cPresident{nibling}, \cPresident{}. While you have no intention of playing favorites, you have to agree that \cPresident{} is probably the best choice to be given the most voting authority among the \pShippies{}. \cPresident{} has the charisma and the clout to win over some of the students from other nations; a necessary step in protecting the \pShip{}. With your help, you believe \cPresident{} can ensure that the storm is sent to one of your enemy nations, to help finish off your ailing foes.

Of course, the tides of victory are flowing in your favor in large part because of the incredible strategic mind of Warlord \cLoud{}, a \cLoud{\person} whose work has quite impressed you. As one of the strongest military assets on the side of \pShip{}, you have to do what you can to safeguard and motivate \cLoud{} to keep doing the good work that \cLoud{\they} \cLoud{\are} doing. Maybe \cLoud{\their} \cWarlordDaughter{\child}, \cWarlordDaughter{}, can be your ticket into \cLoud{\their} good graces, and can help you keep tabs on \cLoud{\their} wellbeing?

On another note, as part of officially completing all of your Journeyman tasks and achieving Master rank as a diplomat, you’ve needed to take on mentoring a couple of individuals. It is a little unusual, but your current mentee is an interesting student from \pFarm{} named \cDisney{}. \cDisney{} is a refugee from a time long past, and has only recently woken up from an enchanted sleep. As someone \cDisney{\they} trust\cDisney{\plural}, \cDisney{} has recently come to you with a fascinating side project that \cDisney{\they} \cDisney{\are} working on - searching for the missing Avatars of \cFarmGod{\full}, the Giant Hummingbirds. Ever since you heard of this project, you’ve been extremely interested - but not for the reasons that \cDisney{} would hope. One of the only tides flowing against you in this war has been the recent loss of \pShip{}’s avatar. If you can find the Hummingbirds before the \pFarm{} do, and muster the resources to remove them permanently, you will ensure that their presence can’t swing the tide of war back in the favor of the \pFarm{}. Of course, \cDisney{} would be crushed if \cDisney{\they} knew the truth of your intentions. You’re still looking for the right moment to convince \cDisney{\them} that your actions are just\ldots

Another thing of somewhat less import that’s been on your mind recently is your love life. You are currently in a stable, loving relationship with your \cBeetle{\partner}, \cBeetle{}, and you wouldn’t change that for the world. The two of you established from the beginning that your relationship would be a polyamourous one - but in practice neither of you have yet found any other suitable partners. Recently, however, the Combat teacher from the \pFarm{}, \cInterpol{}, has caught your eye. Something about \cInterpol{\their} self-assured gait and cool style has drawn you in. If you have time this weekend, you’d love to spend some time getting to know \cInterpol{}, and maybe, if things go well with \cInterpol{\them}, time talking to \cBeetle{} about expanding the scope of your relationship.

%% Another thing is a recent spate of bad luck you’ve been having. In isolation, it’s been relatively minor things - misplaced shoes, a bout of food poisoning, a cup of water spilled on your notes - but taken together, it’s a little concerning. You aren’t quite sure what’s up, but you’re relatively certain that something is. It could be that someone has it out for you, or maybe it’s a minor curse. But keeping an eye out for trouble and maybe consulting with some friendly experts on curses could save you a bit of pain this weekend.

This weekend will be a tough one. Keeping the ritual on track, ensuring that a signed treaty is favorable to your country, and finding a way to end the Hummingbirds are your most important duties -- but if you can find the time, your love life could use some attention as well. There’s a lot at stake in these few days, and you plan to do whatever it takes to bring your country victory.



\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Protect the interests of the \pShip{}, and do right by your home country, her people, and her goddesses.
\item Ensure that any treaty that is signed is highly beneficial to the \pShippies{}. If the other nations won’t acquiesce, the war can always continue.
	\item Ensure that \cPresident{} gets access to the most votes for controlling the storm, and influence as many of the students as possible to send the storm to a nation other than \pShip{}.
	\item Protect the relics, especially the \iNet{} and the \iChalice{}, the two \pShip{} relics.
	\item Find the Hummingbird Avatars of \cFarmGod{} with \cDisney{}. Convince \cDisney{\them} that the proper way to restore balance is to destroy the hummingbirds forever.
	\item Ingratiate yourself with \cWarlordDaughter{}, and through \cWarlordDaughter{\them} ensure that \cLoud{} continues to drive the \pShip{} war effort to success
	\item Find out who arranged a situation in which \cHeadDiplomat{} would have to kill in self defense. Do so quietly; it wouldn’t do for other nations to find out how close someone came to assassinating the \pShip{}’s most famous diplomat.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item If you encounter a celestial beetle, the Avatars of \cTechGod{}, you should certainly take the opportunity to kill it.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cEbbPriest{}} The \cEbb{} \cEbbPriest{\cleric} who is in charge of the delegation from \pShip{} since \cHeadDiplomat{} has lost \cHeadDiplomat{\their} memories.
	\contact{\cChupLeader{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}’s secretary. You’ve been casual friends for years, and you have a healthy respect for \cChupLeader{\their} ability to arrange schedules, manage events, and run interference without anyone realizing it.
	\contact{\cPresident{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}’s \cPresident{\nibling}, and probably the \pShippies{} best chance at not having the storm directed at them this year.
	\contact{\cDisney{}} Your mentee, who is looking for the Giant Hummingbirds.
	\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} The child of \cLoud{\full}. Gaining \cWarlordDaughter{\their} trust will help you keep tabs on the Warlord.
	\contact{\cEvil{}} You aren’t quite sure, but you think you recognize \cEvil{\them}. You think you and \cHeadDiplomat{} might have had a nasty encounter with \cEvil{\them} at some point, but you can’t remember where.
