Free People's Federation %AKA Technocracy

The Free People's Federation is a nation of dreamers, inventors, and artists.  Located in the northern portion of Cengea, and separated from the AGRARIAN nation by a mountain range, the Free people live in a vibrant and beautiful nation whose natural vistas and vast urban centers inspire creativity in all who see them.  The Federation, while seen both nationally and internationally as a beacon of technology and the arts, struggles with the inherent economic class and income differences imposed by capitalism and competition.

Government:  The Free People's Federation is run by a group of officials, led by an Arbiter. Some are appointed, and some are elected to represent various groups.  This Council makes the laws and everyday decisions needed to maintain a thriving culture and economy, but bows to the authority of the Temple where the governance of magic is concerned.  The Council appeals to the Temple on behalf of the people to further tech, magic, and the arts.  They also orchestrates the provision of universal health care, basic income, education, career placement and matchmaking services.

	%Check up on flow after tweaks.
Economy:		Technological inventions are prototyped by an inventor, approved by the Temple, enabled by a
						Magician, Licensed and Granted by the Gov't, manufactured by various means, and sold by 
						various means.  Scientists are researchers who study magic as it applies to tech and the world, 
						often on fringes. Such abstract science often lacks immediate economic value 
						so they usually work for Temple or Gov't.  Art is valued highly and aesthetic and design are marks
						of status.  Acting, writing, painting, harmonious garden design, etc., all are paid highly.
						Education is free through general ed schools that keep kids until they are 15.  After that, there
						are private and gov't run schools that teach trades, but these cost money, more or less depending 
						on specialty.  Scholarships exist only for the exceptional.

												Manufacturing, and Work Mages who are in various industries ie. construction 
												where they use skills to ease, enhance, or enable work.
												Service:		All forms of service industry, including sales.
						International:		Art and performance is the primary export, includes many portraits of agrarian 
												queen, novels and luxuries for overlords, small tech like lights and most big Tech is
												kept back, however in last 20 years there has been a gradual increase in farming tech
												sold to Agrarians, so now they are more reliant on it.  GMO seeds, Irrigation, food
												preservation tech, plant diagnosis and treatment, healing devices for people, weather
												prediction, water conservation tech, cooking tech, etc.

	Consequences:  Koro punishes the following crimes among his followers:  Murder, kidnapping, major 
						Intelectual Property theft, and Scam artistry are punished with memory loss.  Unregulated 
						magical enchantment of technology punished by lifetime inability to use tech or magic.  
						Smaller crimes lead to temporary memory loss, or temp tech ban, or a mark on the forehead 
						that brings social shame.

						religious laws.

%MOVE THE ``this is impossible'' part to individual character sheets
National History:		9 years ago formed alliance with Agrarians.  Agrarians give Free People a better deal on food, and vote storms to Vikings, in exchange Free People will invent way to permanently stop storms, while maintaining magic.  %This is now known to be impossible, and we don't want the Agrarians to find out.  We are getting desperate and trying more and more risky methods to try to create a way to make this deal work and cover our lie.  We've been working so hard on inventing a solution that we aren't properly fortified so if a storm hits us it would be a disaster.
	Storms:		T-6 should have been ours, hit vikings.  Kids who did this vote seen as heroes, but were murdered at the school after the vote.  They are honored and remembered by the entire nation as well as their families. %(Move to individual sheets) Teachers suspect was not accident.
						T-15
						T-24
						T-33
						Nonrotation
	
Education:	Public schooling until 15, then private specialized education.

Technology:		VidCom devices, hoverboards that operate over tracks in roads, toasters, wearable tech in clothes, etc.  

Geography:	Mountain range make up the Southern half of the nation, with forested areas to the Western side, and big cities to the East.

Cultural Foods:	Sandwiches and teas.

Sexuality and relationships:	All forms of sexuality and relationships are considered valid and good, but children are culturally expected.

Taboos/Norms:		Everyone wants to raise themselves up, stand out, achieve wealth, fame, greatness.  Large families are the norm, and each kid is seen as an opportunity, and it's an unspoken shame not to be able to afford higher education for all your children.  It's considered unlucky to not want kids, and usually people who can't will adopt, and people who don't want to have them will join professions that aren't considered as safe, like the Guard, which is a police organization, or Mining, etc which is considered an honorable way to not have kids.

Costuming:		Clothes are often a status symbol, working class folks likely wear loom woven clothing such as denim, cotton, etc, while middle class wear a mix of manufactured clothing that looks like professional or high end leisure clothes of today, synth clothing, and woven, as they can afford.  The wealthy wear the most fashionable of Synth clothing, which looks like shiny fabrics in flowing or fitted designs, accented by wearable or integrated Tech.  All the classes will try to show what wealth they can in their clothes, and this is often a major expense.  All classes and genders are likely to wear some flashy cosmetics and/or accessories, as they can afford.

Magic:	All magic and magical tech is regulated through the Temple.

%Character ideas:  Brilliant inventor limited by church turns to Chupacabra
									%Scientist who needs to make presentation at school about how we will stop the storms and
										%maintain magic, but knows this is not possible with current tech.
									

%%Children of poorer families can petition to wealthier families to be adopted to get access to education. THis raisses the prestige of both families b/c forwarding the benefits for the child.

%%Fashion needs to be one of the industries. Middle class clothes exported to nobility of Farm?

%%How colorful should it be?

%%List types of magic/expand on magic section.

%%Make there be 2 scientists.

%% Relationship to Vikings

 %How is the rest of the government assembled?
