Government:  The Free People's Federation is run by a group of officials, led by an Arbiter. Some are appointed, and some are elected to represent various groups.  This Council makes the laws and everyday decisions needed to maintain a thriving culture and economy, but bows to the authority of the Temple where the governance of magic is concerned.  The Council appeals to the Temple on behalf of the people to further tech, magic, and the arts.  They also orchestrates the provision of universal health care, basic income, education, career placement and matchmaking services.

	%Check up on flow after tweaks.
Economy:		Tech is prototyped by inventor, approved by Church, enabled by Magician, Licensed and Granted 
						by Gov't, manufactured by various options, sold by various options.  Scientists are researchers 
						who study magic as it applies to tech and the world, often on fringes so no real economic value 
						so they usually work for Church or Gov't.
						Art is valued highly and aesthetic and design are marks of status.  Acting, writing, painting,
						harmonious garden design, etc., all are paid highly.
						Education is free through general ed schools that keep kids until they are 15.  After that, there
						are private and gov't run schools that teach trades, but these cost money, more or less depending 
						on specialty.  Scholarships exist only for the exceptional.

%MOVE THE ``this is impossible'' part to individual character sheets
National History:		9 years ago formed alliance with Agrarians.  Agrarians give Free People a better deal on food, and vote storms to Vikings, in exchange Free People will invent way to permanently stop storms, while maintaining magic.  %This is now known to be impossible, and we don't want the Agrarians to find out.  We are getting desperate and trying more and more risky methods to try to create a way to make this deal work and cover our lie.  We've been working so hard on inventing a solution that we aren't properly fortified so if a storm hits us it would be a disaster.
	Storms:		T-6 should have been ours, hit vikings.  Kids who did this vote seen as heroes.  older siblings?  Teachers suspect was not accident.
						T-15
						T-24
						T-33
						Nonrotation
	
Education:	Public schooling until 15, then private specialized education

Technology:		VidCom devices, Steampunk Victorian, toasters, 

Geography:	Mountain range make up the Southern half of the nation, with forested areas to the Western side, and big cities to the East

Cultural Foods:	Sandwiches and teas

Sexuality and relationships:	All forms of sexuality and relationships are considered valid and good, but children are culturally expected.

Taboos/Norms:		Everyone wants to raise themselves up, stand out, achieve wealth, fame, greatness.  Large families, each kid is seen as an opportunity.  It's considered unlucky to not want kids, and usually people who can't will adopt, and people who don't want to have them will join professions that aren't considered as safe, like the Guard, which is a police organization, or Mining, etc which is considered honorable.

Costuming:		Clothes are often a status symbol, working class folks likely wear loom woven clothing such as denim, plaids, etc, while middle class wear a mix of manufactured clothing that looks like professional or high end leisure clothes of today, synth clothing, and woven, as they can afford.  The wealthy wear the most fashionable of Synth clothing, which looks like shiny fabrics in flowing or fitted designs, accented by wearable or integrated Tech.  All the classes will try to show what wealth they can in their clothes, and this is often a major expense.  All classes and genders are likely to wear some flashy cosmetics and accessories, as they can afford.

Magic:	All magic and magical tech is regulated through the Church

Character ideas:  Brilliant inventor limited by church turns to Chupacabra
									Scientist who needs to make presentation at school about how we will stop the storms and
										maintain magic, but knows this is not possible with current tech.
									

%%Children of poorer families can petition to wealthier families to be adopted to get access to education. THis raisses the prestige of both families b/c forwarding the benefits for the child.

%%Fashion needs to be one of the industries. Middle class clothes exported to nobility of Farm?

%%How colorful should it be?
