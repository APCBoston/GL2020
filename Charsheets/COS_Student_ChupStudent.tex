\name{\cChupStudent{}}
 
You are \cChupStudent{} (\cChupStudent{\they}/\cChupStudent{\them}), and an 18 year old, first year student from the \pFarm{}. Most importantly, though, you are a zealous devotee of the \pGoaties{} -- and this weekend is your big break. Just like the rest of your group, you conceal your true abilities. Your reputation is that of a slacker who skates by on \cChupStudent{\their} magical power - but you are cunning, dangerous\ldots and here to win.
 
You were born the second \cChupStudent{\child} of powerful nobles who control land along the \pTech{} border. While this afforded you a privileged life, it didn’t provide much in the way of future prospects -- you were betrothed to a foreigner at a young age for political gain. The certainty that your life was not in your hands has always bothered you. Even being born with all of the magical power in the world into a politically powerful family, you were *still* doomed to be a simple pawn simply by virtue of being born second. The vast majority of people in this world were born with less than you in every way -- and yet, your future *still* felt dim and lifeless. The feeling of helplessness combined with the guilt of having so much left you in a dark place mentally for many years.
 
That was all up until that fateful day. One day when you were about 10 years old, you were out on a leisurely survey of your lands with your servants when you heard distant screams from one of your peasant villages. You and your escorts hurried to the scene, only to find a dead moose and a group of enraptured peasants surrounding a strange \cChupLeader{\person}. Apparently, the \cChupLeader{\person}had dealt with the angry creature effortlessly and was in the process of giving a sermon to the peasants. Your escorts wanted to drive the foreigner off -- but even at that young age, you sensed something special about this \cChupLeader{\person}. \cChupLeader{\They} spoke about true equity -- an even platform for all who would stand on it. About the injustices of the caste system, the tyranny of those with power, and about how only through reimagining the world could it be made fair. 
 
While you were enraptured, your escorts were not as thrilled. They wanted to arrest the man for sedition. But at a word from you, they left the \cChupLeader{\person}be. Second \cChupStudent{\child} you may be, but you still had the authority to pull rank. You returned to your home, with much to think about, after giving \cChupLeader{\them} a small amount of gold for saving your citizens.
 
That incident single handedly changed you. No more were you willing to lament your fate -- you now knew that there were people out there willing to fight to change it. You began sharpening your mind and your skills in preparation to be one of those people. 7 years later, after much clandestine searching, you managed to find them -- and join them. They were known as the \pGoaties{}, and they were everything you hoped. A year later, your training was done -- and you were a full fledged member, ready to do anything it took to bring the world closer to true equity. Between your true skills, your family’s backing, and that of your new group, it was simple to qualify on your first mission -- infiltrating the \pSchool{} as a sleeper agent.
 
Your time at the \pSc{} has been pretty successful. You have grown your knowledge and power, as well as met a few friends along the way. Chief among them is \cAmbition{}, your friend from the \pTech{} and a cunning mind to rival your own. \cAmbition{} is the only person to have seen through your slacker persona, and pesters you to drop it so that you can realize your full potential. But even without that, you’d say you’ve done pretty well for yourself.Through your connections, magical strength, and showing strategic flashes of your true abilities, you have managed to be recognized as a prized student and are the current forerunner for the highest voting authority for the \pFarm{}. Some of the other students are jealous, but that can’t be helped.
 
Now that you’re here and this crucial moment in time has come, you have a few important missions to accomplish. Your primary mission, given to you personally by the esteemed \cChupLeader{}, leader of the \pGoaties{}, is to make sure that the Storm is sent to the \pSc{}. There are a few aspects to accomplishing this. First of all, the more authority you can gain in the selection process, the better. This is made more challenging by your falsely dull persona, but you think you can maintain your current lead without tipping your hand if you are careful. After all, you definitely have the magical power to back it up -- and you have the support of the other members in attendance. 
 
The other important aspect is external manipulation of the votes to send the Storm not to any of the nations, but to the \pSc{} itself. You’ll need to work together with the other members here to make sure that your fake Relic is used in the Ritual so that the \pSc{} is a valid target. You’ll then need to use fair means or foul to make sure that the votes stack in the right way when the chips are down. It will be difficult and dangerous -- but at the end of the day, if destroying the \pSc{} makes the statement you’re hoping it will in the world, you’ll have done your job.
 
Part of making that statement will be making sure that the Bunkers aren’t up to providing their full protection. While \cGenesis{} will protect you and the other \pGoaties{}, if the Bunkers aren’t protecting at full capacity, it will both weaken your opposition during the weekend as well as complete the trap for when the Storm is sent to the \pSc{} when the weekend is done. There is both an initial ritual to damage the bunkers significantly, and the possibility to surreptitiously damage the Bunkers over time while the people in charge of fixing them are distracted. It’s a mission that will require subtlety, but fortunately, that’s your specialty.
 
You also have a few secondary missions to take care of as well. Leader \cChupLeader{} has asked you a personal favor. You are to investigate possible subterfuge on the part of the high ranking official \cChupSecond{}, who is possibly trying to usurp control over the group from \cChupLeader{}. You’re incredibly honored to receive this request, and you intend to fulfill it to your utmost potential.
 
Of a more personal note to you, but still with the group in mind, is the matter of recruitment. You’d dearly love to recruit your best friend \cAmbition{} into the group, not only to gain a powerful mage and talented mind, but also to protect \cAmbition{\them} from your plans this weekend. \cAmbition{} is defined by \cAmbition{\their} ambition, and you think you have a good chance at convincing \cAmbition{\them} to join based on that alone -- but if that isn’t enough, you think you can sell \cAmbition{\them} on the angle that the \pGoaties{} are the underdog, since \cAmbition{} clawed \cAmbition{\their} way up from a poor background. You wish you could have moved on this sooner -- but as a sleeper agent, your primary mission was to remain undetected at all costs. Now though, all bets are off -- and you can make your move. Besides \cAmbition{}, you have a general charter to recruit anybody that you think would be a good fit for the group.
 
On a more awkward note, you have had an ongoing\ldots THING with another student named \cHeir{}. On your first day at the school, you found that \cHeir{}, your betrothed since you were children, was also attending. You had met several times when you were much younger, and had always cultivated a deep and mutual animosity for each other due to the unfairness of the situation. Unfortunately, that all came shattering down when you first laid eyes on \cHeir{\them} on orientation day. \cHeir{} had grown up HOT. You think you’ve managed to avoid giving away your newfound attraction -- but that doesn’t make it go away. Why did this have to become so very confusing?
 
You were still sorting out your feelings when, this morning, you received some horrible news in the form of a letter delivered by an advisor named \cDiplomat{}. Your meddling parents have set your wedding to \cHeir{} to be THIS MONDAY. You weren’t even remotely ready to make a choice yet -- and you resent them for forcing you into this without your knowledge. You’re conflicted about accepting under these circumstances -- particularly with the \pGoaties{} plans for this weekend already in motion. If they had just stayed out of this, you might have proposed to \cHeir{} on your own. Why must parents meddle?
 
Further complicating this is your budding attraction for another student, \cPresident{}. You’re pretty sure that \cPresident{} has been checking you out for a while now -- and that attention is certainly welcome. As the student body president, \cPresident{} is capable, charismatic, and, of course, attractive. You aren’t sure how you’ll choose between the two, and you really wish you didn’t have to -- especially on such a short timeframe.
 
The last thing to worry about is a particularly juicy conversation you overheard at the dorms recently. You aren’t quite sure who, but three voices were discussing an apprenticeship under \cEvil{}, and the mean-spirited mischief and blackmail required to attain the spot. You at first weren’t quite sure who \cEvil{} was -- until you checked the roster of advisors slated to attend this weekend’s festivities. \cEvil{} has been a thorn in your family’s side for your entire life -- and if \cEvil{\their} apprenticeship requires those kind of crimes to obtain, you’re pretty sure that you can leverage that knowledge to find some dirt on \cEvil{\them}.
 
This weekend will be jam-packed.You have a few personal matters of love to resolve -- and, you have a lot of work to do for your group. If you can manage to pull through and pull off this incredible feat, your religion will finally go mainstream -- and you can finally step unburdened from the shadows.
 
\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Surreptitiously work with your counterparts to sabotage the bunkers - without getting caught.
	\item Ensure you get the highest voting authority and manipulate the votes to ensure that the Storms are sent to \pSc{}.
	\item Recruit \cAmbition{} to the \pGoaties{} -- as well as anyone else who would be a good candidate.

	\item Help investigate \cChupSecond{} on behalf of \cChupLeader{}.
	\item See if you can get dirt on \cEvil{} somehow -- what you hear of \cEvil{\their} apprenticeship program sounds pretty sketchy so far.
