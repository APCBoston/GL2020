\name{\cEbbPriest{}}

You are \cEbbPriest{\full} {\cEbbPriest{\they}/\cEbbPriest{\them}}, and well along in years. You are a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{\full}, and an advisor from \pShip{}. You treat the sacred duties of your Priesthood with all of the gravity they deserve, and bear up well under the weight of many responsibilities among the \pShippies{}. While you had no plans to attend the events at \pSchool{} this weekend, it seems your \cEbb{\God} had other ideas.

You grew up in 7th fleet, the child of Clerics of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}. Though you traveled aboard several ships in your youth, you soon returned to the Monastery at Southern Atoll to pursue studies in the priesthood. Very little fulfills you like the spirited debates of theology at the Monastery. Still, no \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{} can live their entire life inside the Monastery. The work of the Goddesses is out among the people. So out you went, to help people learn to let go of the old, to make room for the new. For that is what \cEbb{} is all about: ends, closure, and moving on; cleaning up, learning lessons, and preparing for the next step.

In your own time, you have cultivated a love of history. Most particularly, you have made a study of the creation story of \pEarth{}. It seems no one in recent memory has put much care into the small differences between the way the story is told in each of the nations. But some of the older stories are quite different from how the story is told today, and the question of what really happened intrigues you deeply. You’ve corresponded at times with clerics from other nations, including \cBeetle{}, \cFlowPriest{}, and \cInterpol{}, who all work at the \pSchool{}, as well as \cAntiChup{} from \pTech{} and \cHedonist{} from \pFarm{}. You’d never expected to have a chance to meet up with all of these people in person, let alone at the same time - and at the \pSchool{} no less! Truly, the Goddesses work in mysterious ways.

And yet, this meeting is but a consolation prize when viewed next to the terrible reason you came to lead the \pShip{} delegation this year in the first place. You were on an errand for the church just yesterday when you were summoned to a private residence in order to conduct an investigation. It is not unusual to call upon a member of the priesthood to investigate crimes where the Gods have enacted a punishment, so you weren’t particularly surprised when you first heard the request -- that is, until you recognized the address you were being summoned to.

The storied diplomat \cHeadDiplomat{} had been found by \cHeadDiplomat{\their} spouse that morning, without a memory to \cHeadDiplomat{\their} name, blood on \cHeadDiplomat{\their} hands, and a dead body on the floor. Since \cHeadDiplomat{} was scheduled to lead the delegation to the \pSc{} very shortly, the utmost speed and discretion were necessary in the investigation. Luckily for you, the motive in this case was obvious. The dead body belonged to someone who had taken great pains to be untraceable - obviously an assassin. It followed, then, that \cHeadDiplomat{} had been attacked in the night and killed in self defense. You did your best to reassure \cHeadDiplomat{\their} spouse that \cHeadDiplomat{\their} memories might yet return - the Gods are sometimes merciful when self defense is involved. But such things take time, and the problem of the delegation still loomed. After some consideration, you determined that you needed to lead the delegation yourself in \cHeadDiplomat{}’s stead.

After this decision, you quickly explained your findings to \cJuniorStatesman{} (\cHeadDiplomat{}’s apprentice and assistant negotiator), and \cChupLeader{} (\cHeadDiplomat{}’s secretary). As the new leader and the two people closest to the old one, you decided that the three of you should be the ones to meet up with \cBunker{} and go to the \pSc{}. You then concocted a story that \cHeadDiplomat{} is deathly ill as a cover for the true circumstances. It is imperative that no one find out that \cHeadDiplomat{\they} \cHeadDiplomat{\were} almost assassinated - the situation of the \pShip{} is far too precarious for such an upheaval. The war is at a tipping point, and your ability to negotiate for a fair and balanced treaty is at stake.

Politics are a nearly impossible balance of half truths and hard choices. But your expertise is in creating balance. As tragic as what happened to \cHeadDiplomat{} is, you can’t shake the feeling that maybe you were \emph{meant} to be here this weekend. Someone needs to step up and mediate for the treaty negotiations -- and clearly, that someone was meant to be you. Not that you intend to let the other nations get away without restoring balance - reparations must be paid, and a new understanding regarding the storm drawn up. One that spares the \pShip{} for long enough to rebuild; let the other nations take the Storm upon themselves for at least the next 4 cycles. That should begin to restore the balance that was destroyed with the original betrayal.

To make matters worse for the \pShip{}, it seems that the Avatar of your patron \cFlow{\God} is dead. You know from the lips of the Goddesses to your own ears that the Sea Serpent of \cEbb{} no longer swims on \pEarth{}. This is obviously foul play - Avatars don’t simply die of natural causes. That means emph{someone} killed it. Someone very strong in magic, who had some way to lure the Avatar to shore -- or found a ship treacherous enough to carry them to deep waters. You have little doubt that pirates were involved -- and sooner or later, you will make them pay for it.

Still, all hope is not lost. It can’t be just fortune that \cFlowPriest{}, a highly respected and powerful \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlow{}, is a teacher at the \pSchool{}. Surely, this is a sign that the two of you are destined to work a ritual to resurrect the Avatar! When \cFlowPriest{} first wrote to you of the problem, you could send only your best wishes -- but now you will be physically present to assist. Of course, there are complications of which the answers have yet to reveal themselves. Chief among them is the central problem - where you are supposed to get a live sea serpent to act as a host? Not far behind, though, is the matter of how to keep things quiet. If word should get out as to what you are trying to do, the other nations would surely try to stop you, as being short an Avatar puts the \pShippies{} at a grave disadvantage in the war. 

While you are here at the \pSc{}, you are still a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{}. You have a duty to the \pShippies{} and indeed to anyone who expresses a need for support or council. Chief among your attention will be \cInitiate{} and \cWarlordDaughter{}, two initiates to the religion of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}, who have yet to pick their path and take their final vows. Becoming a member of the clergy is not a decision to take lightly, and you intend to find out for yourself whether these two are truly ready for the life they purport to want. Aside from these two, you have the authority to assist someone in forsaking a previous god and taking up \cEbb{} or \cFlow{} as their patron - assuming they are ready and worthy.

A cleric’s work is never done. As the head of the delegation, and a \cEbbPriest{\cleric}, you bear with you the \iChalice{}, one of the two relics of the \pShip{} which might be used for the ritual. It is yours to protect, or entrust someone to protect, until it is used in the ritual and ready to return to its protections at the 1st fleet Monastery. You also have the ability and obligation to assess the state of the relics for the ritual - sometimes the earthly vessels of so great a quantity of divine power need maintenance. And with most healing being magical in origin, it also falls to you to provide or verify any medicines anyone might try to prepare.

So while your presence here this weekend was unexpected to you, and probably to most of your fellow delegates, it is obvious your Goddesses had a hand in it. Your role here is three-fold: to guide your country to balance, to uncover the truth of the original War of the Gods, and to serve as a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} in all the ways you might be called upon to do it. This is your moment, and you intend to rise to the occasion.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Take up \cHeadDiplomat{}’s role and mediate the treaty discussions. Ensure that any treaty signed is properly balanced and accounts for the pain and suffering of your people.
	\item Research the War of the Gods - this is your chance to find the truth long lost.
	\item Guide \cInitiate{} and \cWarlordDaughter{} in their final steps to becoming full fledged clerics of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}.
	\item Act as a pillar of morality and spirituality to all people by fulfilling the myriad duties of being a \cEbbPriest{\cleric} of \cEbb{\full}.
	\item Work with \cFlowPriest{} to resurrect the \cEbb{} Avatar.
	\item Work with \cJuniorStatesman{} and \cChupLeader{} to ensure no one finds out the truth about why \cHeadDiplomat{} isn’t here.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item 
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cJuniorStatesman{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}’s apprentice and assistant negotiator. You have tasked \cJuniorStatesman{} with managing the voting to control the storm - a task of equal import to negotiating the treaty.
	\contact{\cChupLeader{}} \cHeadDiplomat{}’s secretary. Organized, professional, and hopefully able to partially fill the hole \cHeadDiplomat{} left behind.
	\contact{\cFlowPriest{}} A \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of \cFlow{}, who has recruited your help with the urgent need to resurrect the \cEbb{} Avatar.
\contact{\cInitiate{}} An initiate of the \pShippies{} religion. As \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are} graduating this year, it is past time \cInitiate{} picks a path and comes into \cInitiate{\their} full power, or decide that this is not the life for \cInitiate{\them}. You suspect \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\are} dragging \cInitiate{\their} feet on purpose.
\contact{\cWarlordDaughter{}} An initiate of the \pShippies{} religion. \cWarlordDaughter{} is in \cWarlordDaughter{\their} second year, and you doubt \cWarlordDaughter{their} conviction for this life.
