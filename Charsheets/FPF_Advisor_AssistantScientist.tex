\name{\cAssistantScientist{}}

You are \cAssistantScientist{\full}, (\cAssistantScientist{\they}/\cAssistantScientist{\them}), and 25 years old. 6 years ago you were \cKidScientist{\full}, a student at the \pSc{} -- and the only one out of the group of 12 students to make it out alive. Despite your new name and altered appearance, you've still spent the past 6 years looking over your shoulder, wondering if someone is out there looking for you to finish the job. Being back at the \pSc{} is the best chance you'll have to figure out what happened 6 years ago -- assuming nobody recognizes you while you're at it.

Your family is from a small fiefdom in the \pFarm{} that borders the \pTech{}, but you have lived in the \pTech{} most of your life. Born of a midnight romance, your father returned to \pTech{} when you were still just a promise in your mother's womb. Unlike many families crossing national borders though, your family encouraged you to maintain close relationships with both sides of your lineage, and while you attended school in \pTech{}, you spent many a happy summer break in \pFarm{}, playing in the vineyards, helping with the harvest, and learning about wine -- knowledge that would save your life after you enrolled in the \pSc{} (sponsored by your \pFarm{} family of course) and participated in the Ritual to Control the Storm.

The storm was supposed to go to the \pTech{} that year, not the \pShip{}. You, and every student present, knew that they wouldn't have prepared. All the discussion you were privy to suggested students were voting for the \pTech{}. And yet, somehow, the votes came in, and the \pShip{} were the ones targeted, leaving everyone present stunned. Your thoughts swirled. How many would die because of this betrayal? How had such a conspiracy gone undetected? What would happen to you, as a member of the class that so visibly voted to upset the balance between the three nations? But as you looked around and counted in your head, your suspicion grew.  You had, of course, followed with tradition and voted for the \pTech{}, and you're sure the \pFarm{} student with the most votes had too. Assuming that the students from the \pShip{} hadn't betrayed their own country, it seemed mathematically impossible for this outcome to have occurred.

A toast is a common way for students to celebrate the end of the Time of Deciding. Someone got it in their head that the students should do so alone – as a sort of quick break from having the teachers and advisors breathing down your necks all weekend. So you all adjourned from the Ritual Space to the Student Lounge. The mulled wine they brought out for the toast interrupted your racing thoughts with the automatic and bone-deep indignation your \pFarm{} relatives had imparted to you. This wine was far too fine to be heated and tainted with spices -- this vintage was one of the most expensive and delicate vintages exported by the \pFarm{}! Anyone who could afford to buy such a vintage should know how to properly consume it! Grimacing at the strong odor coming from the carafes, you watched with distaste as your fellow students began to partake.

As you were about to hold your nose and join your friends in drinking from the blasphemously tampered wine, one of the students from the \pFarm{} (who had to be on at \emph{least} their third glass by now) coughed, moved as if to put their half-empty glass upon a table, and collapsed to the floor. They began to seize, and white foam spilled from the edges of their mouth as they fought for air. Within moments, another student joined them, then another. One by one, your classmates fell. As you watched in stupefied horror, you realized in a flash of terrible insight what must have happened: Someone had tampered with the votes, and then poisoned the wine to keep the students from telling the secret. You didn't know who, you just knew you had to run. You couldn't trust anyone! You fled that terrible room where so many had just died, and used the ensuing panic in the school to make your escape without being seen.

How you got down from the floating island upon which the school rests, you will never know. The only thought you had was to flee before someone killed you too. In your confused and distraught state, you ran and ran, and knew not where. Eventually, when you recovered your senses, you realized that you were standing within the Storm itself -- and that the Storm-ravaged \pShip{} was exactly where you needed to be. After all, you didn't know if anyone was pursuing you, and a country ravaged by the Storm was the last place anyone would come looking. The ferocity of the Storms shook you to your core -- but by \cFarmGod{}'s grace it didn't kill you. So you fled -- into thunderstorms, where the rain fell so heavily it felt like you were being battered into the ground, into windstorms where the winds near lifted you off your feet. With the winds howling in your ears like the screams of the dying, all you could hear was your classmate's last moments. And the silences, in those brief moments of respite within the tempest, where everything paused for several minutes before the wind and rain and hail and thunder set back in -- those silences were filled with their wordless prayers for salvation.

The \cSaviourFleet{\full} of the \pShip{} found you -- rambling, muttering incoherently to yourself, delirious with pneumonia and exposure. The crew nursed you back to health, and when you were well enough, you hesitantly told them who you were and what had happened. They understand immediately that this was some plot, and that you were as much a victim as they.

You weren't born to ship life -- it fit ill on you. It pained you to leave your rescuers, but you knew that the story didn't end this way. You had to fix it. You had to work your way back into the \pFarm{} or the \pTech{} and find out what had really happened during the Betrayal. Your new friends on the \cSavFlet{\full} ship were supportive the whole way. They helped you change your identity, obtain forged documents from the burgeoning black market, and remake you into \cAssistantScientist{\full} -- the identity you still go by to this day. You can never repay them for their kindness to you, but you still do what you can. As Assistant Scientist to \cHeadScientist{\full}, you have access not only to your own research pertaining to magic and the ending of the Storms, but to all kinds of magical tech destined for the war efforts. A little magical nudge here or there, nothing detectable of course, is really all it takes to ensure lengthy and costly repairs once the sabotaged tech gets to its final destination.

As for the magic to end the Storms -- well, it doesn't work. In fact, your research has concluded that it is impossible to end the Storms. You and \cHeadScientist{} began to suspect this three months ago, and an experiment two weeks ago confirmed it, which certainly puts the Council and \cHeadScientist{} in a bind. After all, one can't just admit that one has broken a centuries-long treaty and sentenced who knows how many innocents to their deaths with nothing to show for it. You and \cHeadScientist{} are scheduled to present your solution to the Storms at the \pSc{} this weekend. \cHeadScientist{} is really, really worried about it. And while you don't exactly feel like you owe any loyalty to \cHeadScientist{\them}, you know enough to save your own skin. There essentially nil chance you can keep a lid on this secret and prevent anyone finding out. It is far more likely that people will find out, and you'll be stuck doing damage control. If you and \cHeadScientist{} stick together, you and your careers \emph{might} survive. But if \cHeadScientist{\they} manage\cHeadScientist{\plural} to pin this on you, you're screwed. So maybe you should try to beat \cHeadScientist{\them} to the punch and throw \cHeadScientist{\them} under the cart first? It's not so unbelievable that  \cHeadScientist{} wouldn't like to share knowledge with \cHeadScientist{\their} ``lowly assistant.'’ It is a hard decision; your best chance is if you both work together. But can you trust \cHeadScientist{} when \cHeadScientist{\their} precious career is on the line?

There are also other, probably more important things to work on this weekend. Namely, you aim to figure out what really happened 6 years ago -- without blowing your cover -- and make sure nothing like it happens again. This is another politically charged cycle, and similar to 6 years ago, there are important treaties under discussion. You know you are taking an enormous risk by returning to the place where you were almost murdered, but you NEED to make sure history doesn't repeat itself. In order to avoid being recognized by anyone from your old life, you've been using an illusion spell that subtly alters your appearance these past 6 years (a more drastic alteration is too difficult to maintain long term), and your very life may depend on it holding for the whole weekend.

Anyone from the \pTech{} or the \pFarm{} who was present at the school six years ago, including \cDiplomat{\full}, \cHeadScientist{\full}, \cMusic{\full}, \cEthics{\full}, \cLibrarian{\full}, and \cPrincipal{\full} is a potential suspect. You don't know who was behind the Betrayal, but both nations have profited greatly from it. Still, some suspects are less likely than others. \cMusic{} was your favorite teacher at school and \cMusic{\they} cared for \cMusic{\their} students like they were \cMusic{\their} own children; you can't imagine \cMusic{\they} could have had anything to do with the atrocity that was committed. And you've worked so closely with \cHeadScientist{} that it's hard to believe it could have been  \cHeadScientist{\them} either, even if you don't always see eye-to-eye. \cDiplomat{}, as a high ranking government official, is your prime suspect. As for the \pShip{}, you don't believe any of the teachers or advisors would have betrayed their own country, but Principal \cPrincipal{} has been at the school for 200 years. Just because \cPrincipal{\they} originally hailed from the \pShip{} doesn't mean \cPrincipal{\their} loyalty has survived intact for two centuries. To complicate matters further, it is possible that the mastermind was not physically present six years ago, but at the very least their agents must have been here to change the votes and poison the wine. You don't KNOW they'll be here this weekend either, of course\ldots{} but if there was ever a time for a repeat performance of six years ago, it would be today, given all the talk from Ambassador \cHeadDiplomat{\full} about forging a new peace treaty and restoring balance. 

As for people who might help you in finding the perpetrators, \cHeir{\full} is the younger \cHeir{\sibling} of one of your former classmates, \cHeirSibling{\full}, who was your best friend before \cHeirSibling{\their} death. You originally met \cHeir{} at a function held by the Faledon family, where you approached \cHeir{\them} purely to see if \cHeir{\they} \cHeir{\were} at all like \cHeir{\their} \cHeirSibling{\sibling}. The two of you hit it off immediately even though you didn't reveal your connection to \cHeirSibling{}, and you've kept in touch since and become friends. You're certain that if you ask, \cHeir{\they} could be of help with your investigations. 

You didn't pay much attention to the preparations for the Ritual to Control the Storm during your last year at the school, but you feel compelled to be involved now. Something during the ritual went catastrophically wrong before, and without your watchful eye on it, something could happen again. The ritual to maintain the leylines also happens on the 3 year cycle. You would like to at least observe the ritual, and preferably learn ahead of time what is supposed to happen so you can tell if something goes wrong. You're not sure whether that ritual somehow contributed to the Storm being sent to the \pShip{} six years ago, but you don't want to risk overlooking it. And now that you're an advisor, you also have a different role in determining voting authority than you did as a student. You'll have to rank the \pTech{} students based on who you think should have the most votes to direct the Storm. You don't even know how to begin making your mind up.

You also are still working to find ways to help your friends on the \cSavFlet{\full} Ship, and the \pShip{} as a whole. Recently, you learned through the grapevine that a student of \pTech{} named \cTechStar{} engineered a VidCom device that allows easy communication across large distances. Apparently, \cTechStar{\they} guard\cTechStar{\plural} the design for the devices carefully -- but you want to get your hands on either a few VidCom devices (3 should suffice) or the ``Vid-Com Device Blueprint'' so that you can send it to the \pShip{}. Your \pShip{} spy contact, whom you have been sending secrets to for a few years now, is the engineer in charge of maintaining the bunkers, \cBunker{\full}. Once you have secured the technology and passed it to \cBunker{}, your secondary goal is to ensure that no further Vidcom devices are created for use in the \pTech{} or the \pFarm{} – it might be the key to \pShip{} winning the war. You are working on a way to wipe \cTechStar{}'s memory so that \cTechStar{\they} can't produce any more VidCom devices. While you would hate to take such a drastic step, you are prepared to do so if you can't convince \cTechStar{} to defect to the \pShip{} instead. After all, what are one person's memories when weighed against the lives of all those who you will save by removing this incredibly dangerous weapon from the hands of those responsible for the Betrayal?

Hopefully this weekend you can finally lay your burdens to rest and avenge your fallen classmates, while preventing anything from happening to this year's voting class. Somehow, you will bring their murders to justice -- if you're good, you might even manage it without having your cover blown.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Find out what happened 6 years ago, acquire proof, and make it off the island alive with it, to bring it to the proper authorities. \cHeir{} can probably be an ally in this.
	\item Make sure that the Ritual to Control the Storm goes smoothly, including making sure nothing happens to the Relics needed for the ritual. Make sure the Storm does not get sent to the \pShip{} again.
	\item Make sure that the ritual to renew the leylines goes smoothly.
	\item Figure out what to do about the fact that there is no way to end the Storms. Decide whether you are going to work with \cHeadScientist{} on this, or try to scapegoat \cHeadScientist{\them} before \cHeadScientist{\they} can do the same to you.
	\item Secure the VidCom devices (or blueprints) from \cTechStar{} for the \pShip{}, and ensure that the \pTech{} and the \pFarm{} can't get any more, either by convincing \cTechStar{} to defect to the \pShip{} or erasing \cTechStar{\their} memories.
	\item Perform your advisor and assistant duties well enough to not be suspected of having other priorities.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You were not at the school as an advisor three years ago; you were still trying to work your way into \cHeadScientist{}'s lab, and concerned someone might recognize you if you came back (a concern you still have!).
	\item You never actually converted your patron Deity to \cTechGod{}, Patron Deity of the \pTech{}. Technically you still hold \cFarmGod{} as your patron, but hopefully that won't come up.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cHeadScientist{}} Your boss. You'll have to decide if you trust \cHeadScientist{}, or if you are going to try to pin the inability to end the Storms on \cHeadScientist{\them} somehow.
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} \pTech{} advisor and diplomat. Your prime suspect for the murders six years ago. Awkwardly, also the patron of \cHeadScientist{}'s and your research into ending the Storms.
	\contact{\cHeir{}} Younger \cHeir{\sibling} to \cHeirSibling{}, one of the students murdered 6 years ago, who had been your best friend. And as \cHeir{\formal}, \cHeir{} is a big deal in \pTech{}, as well as being a friend to you since you met fairly recently.
	\contact{\cMusic{}} Your favorite teacher from when you were a student. Half of you is afraid \cMusic{\they} will recognize you, the other half hopes \cMusic{\they} will so you can have someone to confide in. But can you trust \cMusic{\them}?
	\contact{\cBunker{}} Your \pShip{} spy contact, to whom you've occasionally passed secrets about the \pTech{} research initiatives in the past. This weekend, you hope to transfer the VidCom devices to \cBunker{}.
	\contact{\cTechStar{}} This year's Techstar, a student at the school, and inventor of the VidCom devices you hope to steal and transfer to the L'eau to aid their war effort.
