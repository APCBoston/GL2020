\name{\cLibrarian{}}

You are \cLibrarian{\full} (\cLibrarian{\they}/\cLibrarian{\them}) from the \pTech{}, and the Librarian at the \pSchool{}. And\ldots{} that's about all you remember. You aren't even sure you remember that so much as your parents impressed these details upon you only a month ago. You must be from the \pTech{}, as that is where your family is. You must be the Librarian, for you found your name on the office door.

You killed someone. You must have. Amnesia like this is the punishment the Deities dole out for murder. It was supposed to be a mercy; a way to make it easier to rehabilitate and reintegrate people into society. But how can you repent what you cannot remember? And the people of \pEarth{} have no love of amnesiacs. Many are still shunned by society, as if someone's desire to murder another human being were as innate as one's hair color, instead of a product of the circumstances in which they were raised or found themselves.

So at your parent's urging, you are keeping quiet about it. You returned to your job at the \pSchool{}, and now you spend hours wandering the stacks when no one is looking, hoping to find so much as a single clue about who you were. You've found scraps. Just scraps for now, but if you keep looking, surely something will come together. You pray to \cTechGod{} in the quiet of your morning meditations, and you can't help but feel \cTechGod{\their} hand on you. \cTechGod{\They} want you to succeed. Some days you wish you could talk to \cTechGod{\them} face to face.

So what do you know? You know that you are patient and kind. Your office is full of plants that your body knows how to care for almost on an instinctive level -- and though there are many, you feel at ease as you care for them. As for kindness, you can feel it in the way the students talk to you. They come to you for little things, or just to talk, and even the most trivial request fills you with joy to accommodate. They also, fortunately enough, seem to like you enough to tolerate your missteps as you learn to be yourself again. It's not much, but it's a start.

You've worked out that \cPresident{\full} and \cLibAssist{\full} are two students that you spent a lot of time with in the Library before. \cLibAssist{} seems to be your assistant -- and has been a godsend in getting your work done. \cPresident{} you're not as sure about -- \cPresident{\they} might just be studious? Either way, both seem to know a lot about the library, and you've learned quite a bit about how to navigate the place safely by claiming to want to test their knowledge. With how dangerous the library is, though, that isn't quite enough. Fortunately, just last week, you felt yourself duck automatically to avoid a magical trip-wire that would have likely set off something unpleasant. Your body must retain some things that your mind doesn't -- and that will be a huge help in keeping your secret.

The discovery of your instinctive ability to protect yourself from the dangers of the Library has given you the confidence you needed. One of your first thoughts was that the answer to your problem must lurk SOMEWHERE in the Library, but you are certain that searching for it in your current state would be suicide - how ironic. Since that incident, you've been delving deeper and searching for answers, but doing so with enough caution to not accidentally die is painfully slow. If only you had more time! This weekend, you will probably be under more scrutiny than ever. You need to find a way to reverse this memory loss as soon as humanly possible. Seeking out others who are in a similar position could allow you to pool resources and search together, or maybe someone has already secretly solved this problem? Revealing your situation to the wrong person could be a career-ending disaster, however. You'll need to ask around subtly, or come up with a cover story, but with the best and brightest minds of Cengea here this weekend, surely somebody knows something that could help you.

In addition to the two students, \cInterpol{\full}, the magical combat teacher, has also been a big help. When \cInterpol{\they} first approached you after the holiday, you were nervous. When \cInterpol{\they} asked point blank if you'd lost your memories after just a few minutes, you nearly died on the spot. But apparently, you were very good friends before. \cInterpol{} has been so kind and patient with you, and done a lot to cover for your missteps in the last few weeks. You are really grateful to have \cInterpol{\their} help -- and \cInterpol{\their} presence has started to be your primary source of comfort. 

Among the librarian's duties are to lead the preparations for the Ritual to Control the Storm, but you can't remember what that entails! You will have to figure something out, and fast. Researching in the library and talking with \cInterpol{} has at least reminded you of the most obvious part — keeping track of the Relics. There are 3 Relics that are stored in the library for safe keeping: the \iNet{}, the \iLariat{}, and the \iScythe{}. These Relics must not be allowed to leave the island under any circumstances. You should also make sure that the Relics arriving with the advisors go home with whichever advisor they came with. You are also supposed to help with repairing the normal wear and tear on the bunkers. This one you've got no idea about, or even if you're SUPPOSED to know how to fix them yourself. You can only hope that \cBunker{\full}, the engineer in charge of maintenance, is the type to issue clear orders and not expect much independent thought.

And then there is the question of where the Storm should be directed. You've ascertained that as a teacher, you are supposed to help determine student voting authority for where to send the Storm. Since your parents live on the northern coast, away from the massive cave networks that shelter much of the \pTech{}, and your nation has had no time to prepare, they would be at particular risk of dying. It is therefore imperative that the Storm go elsewhere -- both because you love your parents, and because presumably they know much about your past and just haven't had a chance to impart that knowledge back to you.

Life at the \pSchool{} is actually quite idyllic. Most everyone gets along. The teachers are like one, big, extended family that transcends country divisions in a way not possible anywhere else on \pEarth{}. The students are inquisitive and clever, and you can see a bright future for \pEarth{} in their hearts and minds. As you sit and watch people bustle about their various tasks, you've taken up the age old pastime of shipping your students and colleagues. The match that has struck you most strongly is \cHeadScientist{\full} and \cChupAvenger{\full}. It hit you this morning when \cHeadScientist{} arrived, and you caught the look on \cChupAvenger{}'s face. \cChupAvenger{} is a good sort. \cChupAvenger{\They} teach\cChupAvenger{\plural} art, and when \cChupAvenger{\they} saw \cHeadScientist{}, it was clear to you that \cChupAvenger{\they} saw the world. You'd like to help them get together if you can.

You also had a talk with \cBeetle{\full} recently about \cEbbPriest{\full}'s research into the creation of \pEarth{}. It sounds fascinating! You'd really like to be involved and chronicle whatever they find. Finding long lost history is kind of like finding long lost memories. Who knows – you might stumble upon something useful in the process. You'll have to chat with \cEbbPriest{} and let \cEbbPriest{\them} know you're interested in helping.

This weekend is a race against time to see if you can piece together a ritual that will restore your memories before anyone finds out you are an amnesiac and kicks you out. In the meantime, you have duties for the Library and the \pSc{} to perform or fake as best you can. Fortunately, you're not alone -- and if your reputation is as good as you think it is, you just might make it through unscathed.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Restore your memories! You haven't found much yet, but surely there's something that can help you in the library.
	\item Avoid getting outed as an amnesiac before you can restore your memories.
	\item Help prepare the Ritual to Control the Storm.
	\item Make sure the six Relics aren't tampered with, and end up where they belong after the Ritual to Control the Storm — the three from the Library should return to the Library, and the three with advisors should go home with those advisors.
	\item Help maintain the bunkers.
	\item Approach \cChupAvenger{} and see if you can help \cChupAvenger{\them} kindle a romance with \cHeadScientist{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You have learned that you were here at the school six years ago when 12 students mysteriously perished after voting to direct the Storm to the L'eau, but you have no memory of those experiences. You are somewhat thankful for that — it must have been terrible.
