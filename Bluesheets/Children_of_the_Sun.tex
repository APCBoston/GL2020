\section*{Form of government:}

\pSun{} are ruled by a monarchy and are currently under the governance of \cQueen{}, considered by most to be a wise and benevolent leader.  With her Consort at her side and advised by a panel of Councilors, she presides over the noble Lords and Ladies of the country, wealthy land owners and mages.  She passes down the laws of the land and ensures that the nobility uphold their obligations and responsibilities toward their people and their lands.

The system of government is such that the eldest child of the reigning monarch inherits, but whoever they marry doesn't automatically take on the title of ruler, but instead becomes a Consort of the current ruler.  Upon the reigning monarch's death, the next closest kin inherits.  Should the partnership be dissolved, the Consort does not retain any titles of King or Queen, and any future children they have are not considered eligible for the throne.  For the purposes of inheritance, gender is irrelevant.

The Nobility preside over their lands and the people who live on and work them, none of whom own any land themselves.  For the purposes of day to day management, they typically designate one or more trusted individuals to oversee their lands during their absences.

\section*{School attendees:}

The majority of the students sent to the \pSchool{} are the children of the reigning monarch or those of the Nobility.

Occasionally, however, a child with magic will be born to a working class family.  When these children are discovered, they are often taken in by the nobility for tutelage.  On the rare occasion that they show especially promising talents, they sometimes will be sponsored to go to the \pSchool{}.

\section*{Geography:}

\pSunCh{} are a people gifted with plenty.  Bounded by mountains to the North and ocean on every other side, they live on a large watershed ripe with farmlands and teeming with birds and wildlife.  

Insert more information once map is finalized.

\section*{Major industries, Economy, and Trade:}

The major industry of \pSun{} is agriculture - with their vast, rich farmlands, enhanced every spring by the mages amongst the nobility and aided by the technology produced by \pCreators{}, the \pSunCh{} produce enough food to feed not only themselves but also  \pCreators{} to the North.  Until the recent breakdown in trade with the \pVikings{}, they produced enough surplus to supply to their nation as well.  In return for the traded food, they receive technology from \pCreators{} that allow them to continue their mass production of food.

It is a time of plenty for \pSunCh{}, but the farmlands which were once fertile have become weary from decades of years of constant, unsustainably exuberant growth.  Without the technology of \pCreators{} and the flood of magics from the nobility of \pSun{} every year, the land would collapse into dustbowl and famine.

\section*{Politics, International relations, and Immigration:}

The alliance between the \pSun{} and \pCreators{} has lead to an unprecedented period of growth for the \pSunCh{} - it has been nine years since they were last hit by the storms, and the guaranteed safety from the storms has meant that they have been able to dedicate themselves to agricultural expansion and improvements, rather than focusing on preparations and fortifications for the next coming.  Should things continue as the leaders of \pCreators{} suggest, with the magic and technology of \pCreators{} soon the storms will hopefully be rectified altogether.  It is unfortunate for the \pVikings{} that they will have to bear the brunt of the storms until then, but they don't have the responsibility of providing food for multiple nations or producing lifesaving technology, and aren't as dependent on magic in the first place.

Relations with the \pVikings{} have been rocky since the Alliance was severed.  The leaders of the \pVikings{} are threatening to pull out from the small settlements and stop protecting them from the sea dragons if not appeased.  A few of the Noble families whose lands border the coast and the \pVikings{} settlements have attempted to speak for them to \cQueen{}, but so far she has decided that the benefits of the continued alliance with \pCreators{} and continued safety of the \pSunCh{} from the storms outweighs the cost to the \pVikings{} and potential loss of protection.

Immigration to \pSun{} is uncommon, but welcomed by the \pSunCh{}.  Unlike the stringent requirements of the other two nations, the \pSunCh{} will take you as you are, so long as you are willing to work and work hard.  Unless the person migrating is possessed of a great skill or talent that is considered of cultural use, they will typically find themselves working the lands.  Immigration away from \pSun{} is more rare.  It is frowned upon by the \pSunCh{} to travel to \pCreators{} for the regular auditions - gifts of magecraft are needed to ensure the seeds sprout every spring, and gifts of music are something that is improper and vaguely sacrilegious for those outside of the priesthood.  As for immigration to \pVikings{} - it is a fantasy worthy of children to want to run away to a \pVikings{} ship, but the realities of \pVikings{} life are hard and dangerous, and who would want to trade a peaceful life on solid ground under the gifts of the Sun with the unpredicabilities and danger of the sea?  Those who fail at both endeavors must return home to the lost standing in the eyes of their families and neighbors.

\section*{Educational system:}

\section*{Cultural foods:}

The food of the \pSunCh{} is a food rich in herbs and spices.  While they may preserve some herbs and spices for sale and shipment to the wealthier people in \pCreators{}, the goods do not maintain their full flavor after the preservation process.  Generally one has to travel to \pSun{} to experience the full depth of flavor that can be found in the dishes of even the most humble of homes.  The food of the \pSunCh{} is also mostly vegetarian, due to the prohibition of their God against the killing or harming of other nonhuman beings.  The people who live along the coasts may trade locally for fish with the \pVikings{} settlements, but otherwise none of the \pSunCh{} consume meat.

\section*{Gender, Sexuality, Relationships, and Family Structure:}

For \pSunCh{}, gender is largely irrelevant when it comes to social standing or societal roles.  For the noble classes, children are expected to pair with at least one partner who is compatible with procreation, said partner also expected to be gifted in magecraft.  Though this partly stems from desires to continue on the family lines, it also stems from a need to provide for the futures of their lands and their peoples - without mages, the seeds will not sprout in the spring and the land will collapse into famine.  

For the working classes, family structures are flexible.  Children are considered a communal responsibility.  With the majority of adults working on the farm during the daylight hours, caregiving responsibilities are shared throughout the community.     



Double down on “gay penguin couples take over eggs”
Adults are getting hurt on the farm too - group / pair of adults who can take on people in community
Children are seen as communal aspect - can be with whoever you want to be but cannot socially choose to be childless, even if old - if 30 and choose not to raise children, people are looking askance at you
Poly relationships are normalized
Folks who are nonbinary / genderqueer / etc - people who are queer make the best children, because look after all of the children, because if you have your own you don’t have time for all of the children
Educators / etc

\section*{Cultural taboos / social norms:}

Leave parts of it up to players
Frameworks for things that players should know

\section*{Costuming Related Items:}

Ie: perhaps farming country embraces hobbit / LOTR type style

\section*{Magic:}

How does it impact your nation
How does it work differently in your nation
DO YOU EAT PAPER???
What does magic look like - generally people in power
If kid has incredible abilities and in very good standing with overlord, overlord may sponsor them to go to the school
ANGST - the kid at a very young age is spotted with incredible magic talent, lord adopts kid into household (caretaker / benefactor), parents (lowly farmworkers) parcel of land sold to neighboring lord so no further ability for child to contact birth parents but child taken away between 4 - 6 years so remember being poor farming child with 16 other children and not enough food to go around no privacy, but now in the lap of luxury and owe lord everything regardless of what things about morals.  
Illusion of power but not actual power, can’t actually lift up other farmworkers, etc
Farmworkers have very little magic, just do manual labor
Overload comes down every spring to push magic under the earth to make the seeds sprout, wife heals the workers
Ability for very obvious visual - kid planted the seed in a pot and poked the soil and it sprouted, or someone injured in farming accident and lays on hands
Seeds would sprout without overlord, but producing 2 - 3x as much as should be able to, stripping lands of their nutrients - make every plant be pest free, every seed sprout, every fruit great, etc etc.  Magic only thing allowing them to produce at scale that they’re doing
If didn’t have magic - mass starvation (land is worn out - dust bowl)  Also have outgrown capacity
Could demonstrate dust bowl effect - know of this farm where there was an uprising and overlord was killed and didn’t have magic and turned into a dust bowl within a year or two and no other overlords would take them because of the uprising
Consequences of no magic:
Can only feed x amount of people.  If you get rid of magic, you will kill x percent of your society.  Mass starvation if magic went away
Vikings - monsters stronger or use magic to fight them, without magic might not be able to - entire set of cultures might lose ability to be seafaring and portions of land might become more dangerous / unlivable due to dragon attacks
What did world originally look like?  What did three nations look like before magic?
Comfortably feeding own population growth + 80 - 90 percent of food to Technocracy plus some food to Vikings, who were they before they could produce all that?
Before fertilizers, had to actively fallow / let land rest / compost / etc - rebuild nutritional value of land.  If have 7 fields, 3 or 4 are fallow every year
As soon as magic goes away, all of land almost immediately inarable.  Famine the likes of what never seen before.  Population of what they are feeding - Agrarian and Mageocracy peoples
Mass starvation, population severely reduced


\section*{Religion:}

Hummingbirds the size of cars
Messengers of the Gods
They are the oracles of the world
Oracles of the Agrarian society 
Communicate through song, have to interpret (may or may not be wrong)
Smaller hummingbirds also useful and revered - not all of them are the same size

\section*{Religious or moral principles:}

Sun worship / weather
God of Cat Worship - active
God of Succulents/plants - resource management
Please the pill bug Gods / ladybug Gods then your soil will be fertile and your aphids will be eaten
Plants / animals

Crimes / Punishment
Crimes punished by the Gods
Murder - punished the same way, but other crimes are punished differently by the Gods
How does immigration play into that
Belief based / consent based religion
Person grew up in farming society, wants to move to technocracy, in order to do that and avoid the wrath of the god of farming, they have to be accepted by God of the mageocracy
Conversion must involve consent on both sides
Part of immigration act is a conversion priest who guides you on the path from one to the other
Don’t need consent of the god you’re leaving, just the consent of the god you’re following
Atheists?
Culture of indoctrination on each nation
Parents will indoctrinate you and when older, can be adopted into another religion
Advantage of joining a religion - all of them apply
Hardest - have three sets of rules to apply (Chubacabra religion is kind of weird, etc) - or maybe it does apply and that’s how they realize there’s suddenly a 4th God
How involved are the Gods?
Maybe normally just accept you, but certain things make it more complicated
Nobody likes murder, but what about theft (Viking God), then someone who has done that previously even if not part of that god’s purview, that God may not be willing to take them in and priest will not be able to sucessfully transition
If you remove your original God and your new God won’t take you, think better be a Chubacabraist
Abusive to animals / run a fighting ring / starve your pets - Agrarian God hates you
Technocracy God
Values self expression / hope / music / art
Book burning - removal of information from the world?  Removal of information from the world - could necessitate a secret bunker of information to ensure that information is not kept
Actively hold people back from their potential
Magic using overlord who keeps serfs and keeps them down (builds success off backs of other people) - bad
Serf who want to play music - good
Chubacabra - Anything that would prevent the chubacabra God from taking people in?  Generally a lot more inclusive and less picky
Looking to steal power - in order to do that, need to steal people
Bring me everybody because I want things?
What does the God actually want?
Power that other gods have - not enough to provide unless God steals it
Someone who is upholding and reinforcing the setup of another God - may be more difficult to convince the acceptance (potential for spies)
Priest - starts out as priest of technocracy and actively works to uphold / increase the technocracist religion - not acceptable
Priest - subverts their religion / not a good priest essentially - acceptable
Gods maybe aren’t always looking into your head, but they do during conversion - but also isn’t looking all the time (usually not) so once you pass selection and are in, then they might not complain
Goal generally to remain unnoticed
Priest who converts through secrecy?  (Magic to change memories / feelings)
How fallible do we want the Gods to be?
Like Tortall Gods - most fallible to other Gods
Not necessarily another person who is doing the magic, but another God
Just lying in bed all “la de da, want a normal life” and the God is like, “hey girl, you’re going on a quest”
CHARACTER - someone is here on a quest they did not sign up for
How do they send people on a quest
People are used to hummingbirds the size of cards being the ones sending the prophecies, but then just hanging out in the garden and a tiny hummingbird comes and says “hey, quest” but in song
Small ones are the ones who are divine?
Jeremy would like to see a hummingbird “cool-aid man” through a window - can we make this happen? :D
Beetles
Generally hard to interpret, but if they want you to go on a quest, it’s very legible
Quest - legible for people who the message is for, difficult for all others
Prophecy
Different Gods have different things to say about the future / the cliff
Chubacabra says FULL SPEED AHEAD!!!

Misc:
People who are frustrated are likely to break the law or break the religion
Benevolent dictator is ensuring that overlords do their job every spring, maintain decent conditions for serfs, etc, X amount of people per farm lands
Some lords may be decent, some horrific, some wonderful - dependent on individuals
Could cause resentment with people at the bottom - causing low socioeconomic to turn to goat worship\\
 
What did that fallout look like for the set of kids that were convinced to vote that way
Technocracy - heros
Vikings - stuck, couldn’t do anything
One of vikings murdered, removing vote
People who did that betrayal are the older siblings or cousins of current batch of children?
Need a character who is driving this investigation
Teachers / advisors would have been there - what if half of the faculty didn’t believe it was an accident but someone who is new now is going to have information that allows them to put that together
