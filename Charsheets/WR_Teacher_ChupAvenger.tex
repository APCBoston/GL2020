%Joe Landolph AKA WR Teacher ChupAvenger 

You are \cChupAvenger{}, a 43 year old Art teacher from \pShip{}, and, to your great regret, Avenger of the \pGoat{}. When the war began, you were blinded by anger at the betrayal of your country’s long-time allies, and made the rash decision to join \pGoaties{}. Since then, you have calmed down, and had a change of heart - and finally now, only after bringing your existence to the brink of erasure, you are seeking a way out.

You grew up on a loving ship amid a loving family, loving life on the waves and appreciating the beauty of the world around you. Your teenage years were primarily defined by travel as you toured many boats, and eventually, the other countries, cultivating a healthy love for the natural beauty of the world and honing your skills as a virtuoso in all kinds of art - the act of creating life from a canvas, the art of cutting away stone and wood to reveal the beauty within, and the art of shaping clay to your will. 

Just as you were settling down back in your beloved \pShip{}, you were approached with a job offer at the prestigious \pSchool{} as the Art teacher. You started teaching at \pSchool{} 8 years ago, and have met many friends among your coworkers, including \cLibrarian{}. You also stuck up a friendship with \cPrincipal{}, bonding over your shared love of \pShip{}, a place \cPrincipal{\they} had not seen in years due to \cPrincipal{\their} duties to the school.

When the \pShip{} were betrayed, you were outraged. You, having seen the beauty that harmony had wrought in the world, could not fathom the sheer audacious evil of the other countries. Your anger was palpable, and you were quickly recruited by \cChupSecond{} to join with like-minded people who all wanted to do something about it - the \pGoaties{}. You took a lengthy sabbatical to become one of their earliest members. IN a word, you became an Avenger - an assassin who is forgotten by others, instead of forgetting; a special boon of \cGenesis{}.

The structure of the \pGoaties{} is deliberately divided into cells. Still, as one of the founding members, you know \cChupLeader{} as the head of the \pGoaties{}. \cChupLeader{} has always been a firebrand. Impatient, reckless, and hot headed. \cChupLeader{\They} have done wonders to advance the \pGoaties{} cause, but every decision \cChupLeader{\they} make\cChupLeader{\plural} is a gamble, and not always a calculated one. \cChupSecond{} is the more level headed second in command. \cChupSecond{\They} play\cChupLeader{\plural} the long game, and are much better at waiting until success is assured to strike. Lately there has been tension between these two. You don’t have a strong opinion since you intend to leave, but if forced to pick, you figure the \pGoaties{} have the best long term chance of survival if \cChupLeader{} were to step aside in favor of \cChupSecond{}. 

Your first target as an Avenger was \cDiplomat{}, and you were glad for it. \cDiplomat{} was the mastermind behind the treaty between \pTech{} and \pFarm{} that ultimately led to the betrayal of the \pShip{}, and you were delighted to be able to take personal revenge. Sadly, reality is not always so kind. The encounter went poorly, and it is a miracle you made it out of it alive. It has since sparked a years long rivalry, in which you repeatedly tried to kill \cDiplomat{\them}, in self defense or otherwise, as \cDiplomat{\they} repeatedly tried to do the same to you. Your anger still burns at \cDiplomat{\them}, and if you can do something to reduce the harm that \cDiplomat{\they} can perpetrate, you’ll gladly take it - but only if you can keep your hands from getting any dirtier, and your existence from getting any more tenuous.

Of all the people who’ve forgotten about you as a result of your activities, \cHeadScientist{} is the hardest. The two of you had a rock-solid romantic relationship, built on love, and trust, and mutual interests. But now \cHeadScientist{\they} \cHeadScientist{\does}n’t remember anything about you. Not even your first date, on which you brought \cHeadScientist{\them} a dozen red roses. Right now, your best ally in this problem is your friend \cInitiate{}. \cInitiate{} knows that \cHeadScientist{} has forgotten you and wants to help. \cInitiate{} is currently under the impression that the origin of the memory problems lies with \cHeadScientist{} as a partial amnesiac, as \cInitiate{\they} \cInitiate{\have} no idea what an Avenger is. You do not trust \cInitiate{\them} enough to dispel this notion at the moment, but this might become necessary if things get drastic enough.

It was this particular instance of amnesia that finally woke you up about what you were doing. The \pGoaties{} may have a noble cause, and you have met many good people in the organization - but ultimately, it isn’t a cause worth throwing away your life and legacy for. It was amidst these thoughts that your good friend \cPrincipal{} figured out what was going on and confronted you. After your initial shocked explanation, \cPrincipal{} surprised you by accepting what you had done and instead of condemnation, giving you help and advice on how to escape your situation. It is an escape that you hope to complete this weekend.

Unfortunately for you, while all members of the \pGoaties{} that you know at present seem to have forgotten you since the incident a few weeks ago, you won’t be able to stay under the radar for long. The incident in question was your first naive attempt to leave the group peacefully, which ended violently after you were forced to kill the officer you spoke to about it in self defense, \cJoeKill{}. While you are quite certain that you managed to clean that mess up by framing the \pGoaties{} enemies, the death did not go unnoticed by \cGenesis{} \cGenesis{\them}self. You have been divinely censured for your actions. You must publicly and prominently display the clover pin, the secret symbol of the \pGoaties{}, wherever you go. This will unfortunately ensure that any present cult members and any savvy enemies of the cult will know your unwanted affiliation. You’ll need to come up with some explanation for the public display of what is supposed to be a secret symbol.

Being forgotten is hard. It leads to such strange interactions. One that is memorable to you, although you assume forgotten by \cLibrarian{\them}, was the day \cLibrarian{} asked you whether \cEthics{} was cheating on \cLibrarian{} with \cChupSecond{}. Your privileged knowledge as a \pGoatie{} meant you knew that nothing of the sort was going on. Rather, \cEthics{} was messing around with the Black Market through \cChupSecond{}. Since you couldn’t reveal that to anyone, you were obligated to tell \cLibrarian{} that yes, \cEthics{} was cheating on them. Hopefully that won’t come back to bite you some day.

Overall, your current situation is extremely complex, and the only way you really see forward is out. Getting out of the \pGoaties{}, renouncing \cGoat{}, and getting back into \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}’s good graces will not be trivial, but it’s your most important goal this weekend. If you can swing it, getting back into your relationship with \cHeadScientist{} would also take a load off of your mind. And if you can, finally settling the score with \cDiplomat{} would be a welcome addition as well\ldots
