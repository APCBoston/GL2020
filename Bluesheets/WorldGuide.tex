\subsection*{L'eau}
\subsection*{The College of the Gods}
There is a lake in the middle of the continent of Cengea. It is not a particularly large lake, but it has many unusual properties due to the ley lines. Ley lines crisscross the ground of Cengea, providing sources of energy and natural conduits for those who know how to use them. Every major ley line in the world connects here. In the center of the lake, the lines rise from the ground, through the water. They twine about each other like vines, and together they reach toward the sky. Up and up until they reach the clouds, where they spread out again, blanketing the world.

The lake is made of something very like water. It tastes like water, quenches thirst like water, and cleans like water, but in other ways, it behaves like a much more viscous liquid. The surface of the lake is normally mirror smooth. No matter how strong the mundane wind blows, the water remains as smooth as glass. Human interference can cause ripples for a short time - i.e. throwing a stone will cause ripples, but they dissipate far more quickly than they should. <INSERT WHETHER CERTAIN CULTURES FORBID BATHING OR DRINKING THE WATER>. It is only in the winds of the Storm that waves begin to form on the surface of the lake.

The lake is also unusual in that instead of having an island on the water, it has one above it. Floating over a thousand feet in the air is \pSchool{}, set on an island suspended in the twining ley lines of the world. The \pSchool{} is part teaching academy, part library, part archive, and part temple complex. The best and strongest students of magic from all three countries are sent to the \pSc{} to finish their studies and ultimately to participate in the ritual that controls the Storm.

\subsection*{The Oceans and the Sea Serpents}
The continent of Cengea has a fairly large continental shelf, with shallow waters extending a good 60 miles out from thecoastline. This is lucky as the largest sea serpents won't venture onto the shelf, except during the spawning season, when the breeding serpents enter the brackish water of the deltas and birth live young. The smallest serpents are no more than 5 feet long, and live in fresh water. They swim upstream, settling in rivers and lakes across the continent, and even stretching their wings to reach terminal lakes. Alas the term ``sea serpent'' is a bit of a misnomer as the young live in fresh water, and even the largest have wings that can carry them short distances. They seem to be particularly attracted to any flying contraptions. The only exception is the Lake under the \pSchool{}. No serpent has ever been recorded to take up residence there, and aerial travel is the only practical way to access the school anyway.

Sea serpent is a bit of a misnomer as the monsters of the Cengean ocean have wings and can in fact use them for short flights. They are particularly attracted to any attempt by humans to fly. The very youngest serpents live in fresh water all across Cengea, and at 10 to 20 feet long can easily take down an unprepared ship. The young serpents grow to six times the size of the largest ships in the \pShip{} fleet before heading out to deeper waters.

\section*{The Gods}
Cengea has a pantheon of Gods. The most important are the Patron Gods: <INSERT GODS for Children and Free People>, and the twin \cEbb{\God}es \cEbbFull{}, and \cFlowFull{}. The Patrons set the rules of Cengea, granting power to those who follow their teachings, and punishing those who disrespect them. The Patrons are matched in power, and each shields their own faithful from the others. The Pantheon also contains many minor gods, who can grants small blessings, but lack the authority to issue punishment, or the power protect worshipers from the Patron Gods.

\subsection*{Magic}
Magic has been a part of Cengea for two millenia. The Patron Gods themselves granted humanity magic, breathing life into the ley lines. Each spoke to their most loyal followers and ordered them to build a school on top of the floating island in the middle of the continent. After a few decades spent mastering enough magic to figure out how to get up there, the people of Cengea did just that. It was not for several more decades that people came to understand why the \pSc{} mattered. Less than a century after the Gods granted humans magic, the Storms began. It was another 30 years before humanity learned to control the storms well enough to direct them in any particular direction

\subsection*{The Storm}
Every \pCycle{} years, a Storm brews on the lake, blocking off access to the school for several days, before spinning off to wreak havoc on some part of Cengea. The students at \pSchool{} can work together, following an ancient ritual, and direct the storm toward one of three areas: The nation of \pFarm{}, \pTech{}, or to the coastlines and outlying islands where the \pShippies{} live and work. Every effort in the past to mitigate the damages done by the Storm has failed. No matter how people to avoid the damage, the same failure occurs - the storm escapes control of the students and wreaks havoc over the entire continent before dissipating. In the end, more damage is done to all three countries than would have been done to a single country if the attempt had not been made.
