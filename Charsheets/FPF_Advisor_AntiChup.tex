%%Black AKA David Black AKA FPF Advisor AntiChup

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the character's current life, problems, and priorities. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life. Current life and situation.   What they think about the most important contacts

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.



Tech adviser - part of the faction trying to root out the cult /// 
Temple's Adviser: second ranking Temple official who has overseen the scholarship of Shantih.  Wants to root out cult!! 	Religious, doesn't remember denying Chris's tech years ago, knows Faledon family, shantih, suspicious of Matt, suspicious of one of the teachers (not chris) Knows cult mostly comes from l'eau, suspicious of Joe who he doesn't know for sure is the Avenger, suspicious of Adi who is CoS and is infiltrating cult.  Supports Shantih for vote.

Adi could help if they connect and learn to trust one another, or could hinder if no trust.

Voting Authority

Competing/finagling to get to have more voting power.  \cScholarship{} MUST gain the voting authority, and Must vote as \cAntiChup{} dictates, and undermining others is fine, and destabilizing other nation's votes or getting more people from any nation voting as \cAntiChup{} wishes is a worthy goal.

Fighting The Followers of Genesis

FoG are Blasphemous and must be stopped.  In addition to the religious implications, they have been selling unauthorized tech and magic on the black market, which is a threat to the FPF economy and way of life.

Suspected FoG:
WR:Jesse leaves the school more frequently than most teachers, according to Shantih, Shannon wasn't supposed to be a negotiator, maybe she's only pretending to be a priestess as a cover for FoG activity, Renee is the daughter of the warlord, and they could be connected to the FoG, Ross is a goody two shoes, and nobody can be that clean.  He's charismatic, and student body president.  Could he be leading the FoG as well?
CoS: Sam has been asking a lot of questions and getting into things he has no business with, and Adi really feels like she's hiding something, and she asks questions that are suspicious
FPF: Matt is so ambitious, and perhaps would go to any lengths to get power, Amanda seems twitchy and paranoid, like she's trying to not get caught at something.

Use an annoying mechanic to check FoG status, if discover FoG, follow to try to catch more of them.  Maybe a time delayed prayer response?
