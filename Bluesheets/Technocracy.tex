\name{\bTech{}}

The \pTech{} is a nation of dreamers, inventors, and artists.  Located in the northern portion of \pEarth{}, and separated from the \pFarm{} nation by a mountain range known as the \pSpine{}, the \pTechies{} live in a vibrant and beautiful nation whose natural vistas and vast urban centers inspire creativity in all who see them. The \pTech{} is seen both nationally and internationally as a beacon of technology and the arts, but struggles with the inherent economic class and income differences imposed by capitalism and competition. To counter this, they have also adopted many social programs and regulations to try to ensure that everyone can afford a good life.  

Eight years ago, the \pTechies{} reached the brink of perfecting a technological solution to the problem of the Storms. With the promise of this new technology, the Council saw fit to form a new alliance with the \pFarm{}, with whom they agreed to send the storms exclusively towards the \pShippies{}, so that the other two nations could have the available resources to pursue this invention for the good of all nations in the long term. In the aftermath of this betrayal, the \pShip{} declared war on the allied nations in hopes of claiming safe land and punishing those who had wronged them.

\section*{Government}
The \pTech{} is run by a group of officials called the Council, which is led by the Arbiter. Some Council members are appointed, and some are elected to represent various self governing groups like the Unions.  This Council makes the laws and everyday decisions needed to maintain a thriving culture and economy, but bows to the authority of the Temple where the governance of magic is concerned. The Council appeals to the Temple on behalf of the people to further tech, magic, and the arts. They also orchestrate the provision of universal health care, child care, basic income, education, career placement and matchmaking services.

The current council numbers 12 people who are notable in many different fields. The members of the Council most relevant to game are as follows:
		Arbiter:		\cArbiter{} speaks as leader of the group and only votes in ties.
		Elected:	\cElected{} is the current official elected by the general public. 
		Old Family:	\cFaledonParent{} is the head of the Faledon family, who were the original philanthropic family who designed the structure of the government during the founding of the nation, and who have for generations since spoken for the rights of the poorest. They are an incredibly wealthy family, with many patented inventions, and they provide many scholarships for promising but underprivileged students seeking higher education or apprenticeship. Such students usually go on to work for Faledon Industries.
		%% Economist:	\cEconomist{} is the head of the Economics department of the Free People's National Bank.
		%% Educator:	Every two years the Heads of Schools elect one of their number to represent them.  The current Educator, \cEducator{}, has been reelected eight times so far, and is likely to be so again, as they’ve done a credible job.
		Tech Star: Annually a huge Tech Expo is held, and anyone who has, without the help of a team, invented a new piece of technology may compete for the position of Tech Star, and they speak for the young and brilliant. The current Tech Star, \cTechStar{}, is young enough to also be a student at \pSchool{}. The Tech Star only governs for a year before the next one is chosen.
		%% Union Administrator:	Each Union's Leader reports to the Union Master, who represents the interests of all the Unions to the Council.  An election is held every five years within the Unions for this position.  The current Union Admin is \cUnionAdmin{}.
		%% Patent Holder:	 \cPatentHolder{} is a brilliant career inventor, who was granted a Council seat because she holds a record three times more successfully produced individual patents than her next competitor.
		%% Temple Scion:  \cTempleScion{} known as “\cTechGod{}’s Grace”, is the leader of the Temple and speaks on behalf of the Temple's interests.
		%% Magician in Chief:  \cMagician{} is the Temple Magician in charge of regulation of tech enabling magics.
		%% Lead Scientist:  \cHeadScientist{} is a research scientist employed by the council who studies subjects deemed relevant.  Current primary project is the means to stop the Storm, and it is in this capacity that \cHeadScientist{} will be attending this weekend’s events at \pSchool{} as an Advisor.
		War Consultant: A Consultant is selected by the other board members to sit on the Council and speak on matters regarding the war effort.  The current Consultant is \cWar{}.

\section*{The War Effort}
The war with \pShip{} was not the predicted outcome of the Treaty with \pFarm{} made six years ago, as the \pShippies{} have historically been slow to adopt great changes. Unfortunately, a warmonger rose up among the \pShippies{} and roused them to attack viciously, stirring sea serpents to ravage coastal lands. This Warlord, \cLoud{\full}, is reviled by \pTechies{} and \pFarm{} alike, and every encounter with the \pShippies{} has been brutal. And if that were not bad enough, the \pShip{} has also unleashed their ``Pirates,’’’ who seem bent not on war, but on looting, and have no qualms about killing to take what they want, amnesia or no. As such, the \pTech{} has suffered terrible losses, and national morale is at an all time low for those who live in coastal regions. 

Thankfully, the trebuchets invented three years ago are going a long way towards countering \pShip{} incursions, and the Council and the Temple have been acting as one to counter the \pShip{} war efforts. The new defense is currently holding the \pShip{} mostly at bay -- hopefully long enough to finish the research on ending the Storms, and reach a peaceful resolution to the war.
	
\section*{Economy}
Technological inventions go through a lengthy process to be produced. Tech is prototyped by an inventor, approved by the Temple, enabled by a Magician, licensed by the Council’s Office, and finally manufactured and sold in either the free or subsidized markets. 

Scientists are researchers who study magic as it applies to tech and the world, often in esoteric fields. Such abstract science often lacks immediate economic value, so they usually work for the Temple or Council. Art is also valued highly, as aesthetically pleasing clothing and possessions are marks of status. Acting, writing, painting, harmonious garden design, etc., all are paid highly.  

The recent war with \pShip{} has cost both lives and resources as well as inciting civil unrest -- since as per usual, the poorest have been hit hardest by the war, and have the fewest resources to replace the dried up imports from the \pShippies{}. The elites and the Council are concerned at the state of the economy, which is showing signs of instability.

\subsection*{Trade}
Art, performance, and fashion are the \pTech{}’s primary exports. This includes such things as novels, portraits, and luxuries for nobles, but also performances and shows for the common folk. Small tech like lights and most big Tech like industrial machinery is forbidden from being exported. However, in the last 20 years, and especially since the alliance was made, there has been a marked increase in farming tech sold to \pFarm{}

Historically, much of the nation’s food is imported from neighboring countries, both from the \pShippies{} who sail the seas, and the \pFarmers{} who work the fertile lands to the South. Food has been scarcer as a result of the war, and the poor are struggling to keep food on the table.

All official trade with \pShip{} stopped when the war began, although there is still some black market trade occurring that the officials have not yet been able to thwart. This has become a major problem, since the \pShippies{} have been able to more easily react to new \pTech{} innovations during wartime than they would have been otherwise able to.

\section*{Technology}
Which tech is greenlit for sale and manufacture runs is regulated by the Temple, and must be activated by a Temple appointed magician. Only the simplest of tools do not run on magic, so the temple has shaped day-to-day life in the \pTech{}. Tech that hasn’t been activated by a magician will not function, and non-Temple appointed mages are forbidden on penalty of divine punishment from activating tech.

Many modern amenities have an approximation produced in the \pTech{}, including refrigerators, toasters, and showers. Technology such as surgical equipment, industrial machinery, and hover transports is common as well. VidCom devices, which are communication technology that approximates a modern day cell phone, are the most high profile invention to come out of the annual TechStar competition this year, but they are not yet widespread out of fear that they will fall into the hands of the \pShippies{}. One of the most prized pieces of technology is tech clothing, which is clothing that can display video or changing patterns, totally configurable by the wearer. 

\section*{Religion}
The \pTechies{} follow \cTechGod{}, the \cTechGod{\God} of Knowledge and Inspiration. \cTechGod{}'s Avatars are the Celestial Beetles, small insects who walk through ink in order to leave the \cTechGod{\God}’s runic messages on paper for scholars to interpret.  

The Temple strictly regulates the use of magic and places limitations on what technology can be produced. They do this in the interest of ensuring that the tech benefited the people and encouraged peace, unity, equality, and innovation.

The Circle of Five, the highest officers of the Temple, govern according to a written conscriptus of religious laws. The Temple was founded at the birth of the Nation, by the Grace of \cTechGod{}.

\cTechGod{} punishes the following crimes among \cTechGod{\their} followers:  Murder, kidnapping, major Intellectual Property theft, and scam artistry are all punished with memory loss. Unregulated magical activation of technology, on the other hand, is punished by a lifetime inability to use magic or technology. If the crime is not as severe, it may lead to temporary memory loss or a temporary mark on the forehead that brings social shame.

%% \section{The Storm}
%% The Storm six years ago should have been ours, but as per the treaty with \pFarm, it was directed to hit \pShip.  The students who cast this Vote are heroes, but were murdered at the school after the Vote.  They are honored and remembered by the entire nation as well as their families. Past storms that struck \pTech{} were 15, 24, and 33 years ago, during which time the three nations had a rotation Treaty, prior to which time there were frequent battles, assassinations, and machinations to direct the Storms.
	
\section{Education}
Education is free through general education schools that keep kids until they are 15. After that, there are private and Council run schools that teach trades, art, performance, and technology -- but these come with a hefty tuition depending on the exact specialty. Children of poorer families can petition wealthier families for adoption to get access to higher education. This raises the prestige of both families because both are seen to be prioritizing the education of the child, which is paramount. A few truly exceptional students may also be granted scholarships -- but this is a prize dangled in front of students far more often than it is realized. 

\subsection{TechStars and Tech Faires}
Each Technology specialized Upper school holds an annual Tech Faire, where both students and non-students may apply to present their inventions. The best of these inventions will be sent on to compete in the National TechStar Competition to determine which inventors win the prestige that year, and who gets to take the TechStar’s seat at the council.

\section*{Cultural Art, Clothing, and Food}
The \pTech{} is enchanted by art of all kinds. Performances of all kinds are treasured and made available to all at any price point. Fashion is a national pastime, and your clothes are a primary determinant of your status. Artwork is ubiquitous, and artists of all kinds are highly paid and respected. Anywhere you walk down the street, you will see art emplacements on street corners, walls, and atop buildings, and hear music floating from all directions. It is truly a haven for artistry.

Clothes are often a status symbol in \pTech{}.  Working class folks generally wear loom woven clothing such as denim, cotton, etc.  The middle classes wear a mix of manufactured clothing similar to the professional or high end leisure clothes of today - synth clothing, and woven - as they can afford.  The wealthy wear the most fashionable of Synth clothing, shiny fabrics in flowing or fitted designs, accented by wearable or integrated Tech.  All the classes will try to show what wealth they can in their clothes - often a major expense.  All classes and genders are likely to wear some flashy cosmetics and/or accessories, as they can afford.  Recently militaristic fashion has become quite exciting and popular, as people glorify the war effort, and honor soldiers.

A staple food much beloved amongst \pTech{} are sandwiches - toasted, roasted, open faced, wrapped, deconstructed\ldots the sandwich is practically a symbol of the creativity that lies at the heart of every citizen.  And a sandwich is not truly a sandwich without a steaming mug of fragrant tea to go with it

\section*{Norms and Taboos}
Every member of \pTech{} society wants to raise themselves up. They wish to stand out, achieve wealth, fame, greatness, and make a name for themselves. Large families are the norm, as each kid is seen as an opportunity to raise a genius. It's an unspoken shame not to be able to afford higher education for all your children, and so poorer families do everything in their power to get their children education -- including giving them up for adoption to wealthier families.  

While all forms of sexuality and relationships are considered valid and good, it's considered unlucky to not want kids while in a relationship. Couples that can’t produce children for one reason or another will typically adopt. People who don't want children will sometimes join professions that aren't considered as safe, like the police, mining, or military. In dangerous jobs like these, it is considered an honorable choice to not have kids and risk orphaning them.

\section*{Opinions about People from the Other Nations}			
The \pFarmers{} are a coarse people, stuck in the past and a little bit backward. The feudal structure of their country stifles genius that can come from the lower classes, and elevates the incompetent to high positions. Their idea of ``adoption'' is also backwards -- while families should be free to give children better lives somewhere else, that should be with the consent of both parties. Their denial of music from most people is also a shame -- living without music would be horrid.

Still, they are reliable allies and solid trading partners. It would be wrong to think too harshly of those that have been staunch allies for a bloody war.

% CoS - Course, feudal structure and “Adoption” is really, really whack - it’s not consenting to steal their children, Also stuck in the past. Locked down music, ew

The \pShippies{} are a warlike people. They spend most of their lives fighting something or other, whether it be the other nations, sea serpents, or each other. It’s no wonders that odious pirates have sprung from their ranks! While not as coarse as the \pFarmers{}, they too lack refinement, and do not put enough stock in the effort and life saving power of technology. 

The two strangest things about the \pShippies{} are their form of government and their chosen \cEbb{\Deity}. Why would you let children as young as 14 make ANY kind of decision more impactful than breakfast? And why on \pEarth{} would you worship a \cEbb{\Deity} dedicated to destruction, when there is so much to build in life?

% L’eau - Warlike, fighting, arguing - too much piracy. Also course. Look down on them for letting young people into their policy arguments (14 year olds? really?). Why do you worship a goddess of destruction?
