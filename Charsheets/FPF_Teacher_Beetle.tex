\name{\cBeetle{}}

You are \cBeetle{} (\cBeetle{\they}/\cBeetle{\them}), and 52 years old. You are a Priest from \pTech{}, and teach religion at \pSchool{}. You are incredibly knowledgeable about the Gods of \pEarth{}, and the religions derived from them, and enjoy sharing that knowledge. Still, you are ready to try for the next stage in your life, hopefully by taking over as Principal when \cPrincipal{} steps down.

Your life growing up in \pTech{} was wonderful. Your family was supportive of your interest in religion, and had the financial means to grant you easy access to the church. In one program, you were assigned a pen pal from \pFarm{} named \cMusic{}. The two of you hit it off, and corresponded long after the program ended.

Your religious studies were tremendously fulfilling, and you entered the Priesthood fairly young. You excelled in your studies, and were eventually granted the honor of taking care of the Celestial Beetles. With this new phase in your career came more time to study religion more broadly. You invested great time and effort in learning about the connections between the Gods, and between the Gods and their Avatars. A God without their Avatar would have substantially less ability to effect \pEarth{} and protect their people. It is an idle curiosity that the giant hummingbirds of \cFarmGod{} haven’t been seen in almost a decade, and explains why the Celestial Beetles are so carefully protected.

It bothers you that your deep devotion to \cTechGod{} and your respect for the truths of your religion are not universally shared among the Priesthood, especially by \cAntiChup{}. \cAntiChup{} seems less concerned with the will of \cTechGod{} and more interested in the power and intrigue involved in more worldly affairs. such as the war between the nations.  You know this war, and the betrayal of the \pShippies{} can’t truly be the will of \cTechGod{}, and you feel sure that \cAntiChup{} will someday be shown the error of \cAntiChup{\their} ways. You only hope that something can be done to ensure that \cAntiChup{\their} inevitable fall from grace doesn’t destroy the prospects and future of \cScholarship{}, \cAntiChup{}'s promising young initiate. No student should suffer for their mentor’s lack of wisdom, and perhaps there is something you can do to help ensure that \cScholarship{}'s future in the priesthood is secure and that \cScholarship{\they} get a chance to learn the true path of \cTechGod{}.

As your career grew and changed, you were selected to teach at \pSchool{}. When you got there, you found, to your great delight, that \cMusic{}, your childhood pen pal was selected too! While \cMusic{} can be a little nosy, \cMusic{\they} clearly \cMusic{\have} a good heart and always make you laugh. You’ve never had a better friend.

You are also in a stable poly relationship with \cJuniorStatesman{}. You have had other partners in the past, and none of them have made it up until this point - but \cJuniorStatesman{} has lasted through it all. You don’t see \cJuniorStatesman{\them} all that often, as \cJuniorStatesman{\they} only visit \cJuniorStatesman{\plural} the school on occasion, but the two of you make up for it whenever \cJuniorStatesman{\they} \cJuniorStatesman{\does} make it back.

Having been a teacher of religion almost as long as you have been a Priest, you are enormously honored and excited that \cPrincipal{} is considering you to be \cPrincipal{\their} successor as Principal of the \pSchool{}.  It looks like either you or \cMusic{} will be successful in impressing \cPrincipal{} and securing the promotion by the end of the weekend.  Each of you has been given a task usually performed by the Principal, and yours is the management of the powerful ritual used to strengthen the Ley Lines that support the school and spread magic throughout the lands.  You are confident that you can impress \cPrincipal{} and ensure that the Ley Lines are at full strength in addition to helping \cPrincipal{} in overseeing the even more important Ritual to direct the Storm. You are an expert in wrangling people and ensuring that complex processes go off without a hitch.

About a year ago, while home on a break, you happened to be alone in the room with a Celestial Beetle while studying in the Church. Unexpectedly, a message from \cTechGod{} came through the Beetle, without any of the usual pomp and circumstance. The message was simple - “Bring me with you.” You were confused, but one does not simply deny the word of a God - you complied and secretly slipped the Beetle into your pocket, knowing that the other Priests wouldn’t believe you. Fast forward to last week, when you had a panicked realization in the middle of the night. If you become the Principal, you will no longer be the guardian of the Beetle, and you’ll need to find someone trustworthy to bring it back. That person can’t be \cScholarship{} - even without \cScholarship{\their} association with \cAntiChup{}, \cScholarship{\they} can’t be considered a full priest yet. And of course, \cAntiChup{} \cAntiChup{\them}self is not not an option. For the last week, you’ve been scouting around for a priest that you can trust to take the Celestial Beetle safely back to the \pTech{}. While you were unable to locate an existing priest, you unexpectedly found a new prospect - \cHeadScientist{}, who wants to join the priesthood. If you can successfully induct \cHeadScientist{}, that takes care of returning the Avatar safely to your nation - IF \cHeadScientist{\theyare} trustworthy.

This weekend will be a full one. Beating your friend \cMusic{} to the principality and all of the difficulty that goes with the new role will be one thing. Making sure the ritual to control the Storm goes smoothly is another.  At the end of the day though, the thing that will make you happiest is spending time with \cJuniorStatesman{} while you have the chance. 

%%Beetle mempack:  If x conditions are met find a place where you can commune with the Beetle, spend 5 min splattering ink, with beetle visible.  Then read the memo.
