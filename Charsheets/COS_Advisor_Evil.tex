\name{\cEvil{}}

You are \cEvil{\full} (\cEvil{\they}/\cEvil{\them}), and 50 years old. You are an advisor to \cQueen{\full}, and here to advance a number of your own plans. If ever the term ``evil mastermind'' applied, it would apply to you. You may not have started off that way, but after a lifetime of playing the game, you've come to recognize just how good at it you are.

You are the youngest \cEvil{\child} of mid-level nobility in \pFarm{}. Your family would be a lot higher ranking if it weren't for the pirates. Your family holds land on the southern coast, near Fleet 7 waters. Every year, the pirates would raid the coast, extorting ridiculous prices in exchange for ``protection'', and stealing whatever they wanted when their demands weren't met. You hate them with every fiber of your being. Between your family's plight and the fact that as the youngest child you stood to inherit no land, your prospects growing up were modest at best; therefore, you resolved to take your fate into your own hands. You immersed yourself in the brutal politics of the \cQueen{\Majesty}'s court. There, something wonderful happened -- and then something terrible.

You met \cPirateChildParent{} and fell in love. Unfortunately, you also met \cEvilNemesis{}. \cEvilNemesis{} was incredibly powerful in the \pFarm{}, took an instant dislike to you, and made the pirates that harry your family's coastline look like children. The two of you fought on many fronts for several years. More than once, \cEvilNemesis{\they} nearly succeeded in killing you, or disgracing your family, or some other equally terrible outcome. But one day, \cEvilNemesis{\they} went too far. Not six months after \cPirateChildParent{} had given birth to a baby \cPirateChild{\kid}, \cEvilNemesis{} nearly eliminated your family by setting your house on fire. You only just saved your \cPirateChild{\child} -- but could not save your \cPirateChildParent{\spouse}.

Realizing how dangerous your nemesis was, you made a decision you knew was necessary -- but that still haunts you every day of your life. To protect your \cPirateChild{\child}, you gave \cPirateChild{\them} away. Through a series of contacts, you tracked down a trustworthy connection in \cEthics{\full}, a teacher at the College, and asked \cEthics{\them} to pass the child on to a family somewhere you could never find. Your \cPirateChild{\child} was safe, but \cPirateChild{\they} \cPirateChild{\were} also gone from your life forever; that was 18 years ago. 

Eight years ago, after 10 years of trying to rid yourself of \cEvilNemesis{} through political maneuvering and backstabbing, you finally, FINALLY, succeeded. You were now one of the most powerful members of the \pFarm{} -- at least as far as soft political power went. Now that your own life was secured, you finally had time to look beyond your own borders, and began collaborating with \cDiplomat{\full} -- who had quite the grand plan. The scientists of the Free People's Federation had been researching how to permanently end the Storms, but their progress was threatened by the prospect of the next Storm being directed at their nation in accordance with the treaty. All \cDiplomat{} needed was your help buying their scientists a little time – by directing the Storm at \pShip{} out of turn instead. 

The world would be a much better place without the Storms - anyone can see that. You enlisted a scrappy young scientist named \cHeadScientist{\full} as the cat's paw for your plan, since \cHeadScientist{\they} was slated to be at the College of the Gods for that Time of Deciding as an advisor from the Free People's Federation. You procured a set of fake voting stones, had  \cHeadScientist{} swap them in right before the voting stones were passed out to the students, and then swap the real voting stones back in after the Storm's course was set so there would be no hanging thread. The fake stones were a huge source of unregulated magic that \cHeadScientist{} could then do with as \cHeadScientist{\they} pleased; that, in combination with a promised promotion from \cDiplomat{}, was ample payment for this minor task. You purposefully kept \cHeadScientist{} in the dark about every other part of the plan. 

Phase 2 of the plan was to deal with the 12 students whose votes you had rigged to send the storm to \pShip{}, who could easily have raised the alarm about the fraudulent outcome – \cDiplomat{} was too short sighted to have thought that part through, but you knew what had to be done. So you made the necessary arrangements; a few words in the right ears, and you had yourself an assassin willing to sacrifice their memories in order to poison the wine used for the celebratory toast. Even though you were normally one of the Advisors for the Time of Deciding, you begged off that year in order to maintain plausible deniability, claiming you wanted to ``give someone else a chance.'' 

Perhaps that was a mistake, because without your guiding hand, the assassin failed to definitively eliminate all 12 students; \cDiplomat{} informed you afterwards that only 11 bodies were found, with one student, \cKidScientist{\full}, missing. Despite searching far and wide, you were never able to locate \cKidScientist{\them}. While the most plausible explanation is that \cKidScientist{they} attempted to flee and died of the poison somewhere in the wilderness, you have not gotten this far by discounting the longshot scenario — that \cKidScientist{} may yet live. Interestingly, the official line from the College has consistently been that all 12 students perished, raising your suspicions that someone on the faculty is covering for \cKidScientist{} and may have helped them escape. You will definitely be watching your back this weekend. 

After that sordid ordeal, you reclaimed your annual position as an Advisor for the Time of Deciding, claiming that the Advisor who had stood in for you was incompetent, given that 4 of the best minds in the Children of the Sun perished under their watch.

Fast forward to today, and it's a whole different host of problems. The pirates from \pShip{} are more of a nuisance than ever, but even worse, the whole damn nation is at war with yours and the Free People's Federation. War is a complicated beast – especially this one. The betrayal of the L'eau will ultimately benefit them too – ending the storms is worth almost any sacrifice. Endless generations without the storm are surely worth a couple of tough years. But then the L'eau had to go start a war, and make the loss of life so much higher than it needed to be. You intend to end it in your nation's favor, by any means necessary. \cLoud{\full} is the lynchpin on which the \pShip{} war effort hinges. If \cLoud{\they} could be assassinated, the \pShip{} would soon fall under the collective might of the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}. Ironically enough, the key to bringing \cLoud{} low lies in \cLoud{\their} \cWarlordDaughter{\child} being at the \pSchool{}. You have begun preparations to use \cWarlordDaughter{\them} as leverage to get the warlord to show \cLoud{\themself} at a known location so you can send an assassin to end them. You will probably need the help of your old co-conspirator, \cDiplomat{}, in order to pull this plan off; fortunately, eliminating the Warlord is in both your interests.

The Warlord will never agree to the peace treaty that \cHeadDiplomat{} and a few other delegates have started talking about, and regardless, you have no interest in a treaty or ceasefire when total victory is within your grasp. Technically, you are the head Children of the Sun Advisor, so you are supposed to sit in on these negotiations. If you can't convince the other Advisors to disband or boycott the talks, you might be able to pawn the task of pretending to listen off on either \cWildCard{\full} or \cHedonist{\full}, two of the other Advisors. Unless, of course, someone among the Children of the Sun starts advocating for peace, in which case you'll have to bring your authority to bear and make sure they don't influence the proceedings.

You have enemies, of course, quite a lot of them at this point. You've made a point of making life as difficult for pirates as you can manage. You've even had a run in with the infamous Silent Fog pirate ship. The family of one of the students here, \cChupStudent{\full}, is another enemy — rival nobility from Children of the Sun. \cInterpol{\full} is a pain in your ass as well. \cInterpol{\Theyare} always nosing in your business, \emph{supposedly} by coincidence. And now \cInterpol{} is employed here at the \pSc{}, which is another inconvenient ``coincidence,'' to say the least. As for \cDiplomat{}, the two of you have lots of history of collaborating -- but that really just means that you both have dirt on each other. You intend to gain the upper hand in this power struggle, to ensure that if anything you've done together were to come out, you could pin it all on \cDiplomat{} and get away scot free. Lastly, there is \cJuniorStatesman{\full}. It's not so much that you hate \cJuniorStatesman{} personally, but that \cJuniorStatesman{\their} family has been opposed to your family for generations -- and you have every reason to believe they're connected with pirates, if not pirates themselves. Any chance to strike back against that family is not to be missed. Lastly, there is \cPirateChild{\full}, a student you only just met after arriving on campus. There is something suspicious about \cPirateChild{\them} — a certain swagger, a cocky sneer — that just screams ``pirate'' to you. You even went so far as to examine  \cPirateChild{\their} application to the college, and the papers looked forged to you. Still, \cPirateChild{\theyare} only a child, and you have no proof\ldots yet. You will have to keep a close eye on \cPirateChild{\them} this weekend.

You are also intrigued by the fact that a little birdy told you \cCurse{\full} (a \textbf{commoner} who somehow managed to worm \cCurse{\their} way into being an Advisor for the \pFarm{}) and \cFlowPriest{\full} (a \cFlowPriest{\cleric}/teacher from the \pShip{}) have been in constant correspondence, working to enchant some kind of plant, of all things -- which, as far as you've learned, might manage something as amazing as to open a path to the Realm of the Gods! Obviously, once the enchantments on them are completed, they would hold enormous value. Those seeds would definitely be worth stealing before they are planted somewhere, if you can manage it.

A little closer to home is your relationship with \cPrince{\full}. The two of you work together often, and you are even willing to admit that you appreciate \cPrince{\their} company, and respect \cPrince{\their} scheming mind. You have invested serious resources in facilitating \cPrince{\their} rise to power, knowing full well that \cPrince{\they} intend\cPrince{\plural} to take the throne one day. You don't usually take sides before it is obvious which way a conflict will resolve, but you took this risk, and now you're committed to seeing Sansum on the throne -- in exchange for a major elevation of your public position, of course. It should serve both of your ends that you are here at \pSchool{}, where \cPrince{} is currently teaching and able collaborate in person. 

Still, \cPrince{} appears to have run into some sort of trouble of late. Word among your agents is that \cPrince{\their} signet ring might have been\ldots liberated from \cPrince{\their} possession. Such artifacts are incredibly politically powerful, and even aside from what you could do with it yourself, the \cQueen{\Majesty} would reward you handsomely for returning it -- at the very least with lands and a title of your own, which would secure your legacy. You could of course also give it back to \cPrince{}, if \cPrince{\they} could offer you something more valuable for it. Still, it is not your practice to put the cart before the horse — first you have to find the damn thing. The local black market might be the first place to look, though you'll need to be subtle about trying to make contact with its members. Unfortunately, such a powerful artifact is sure to have a protective charm on it that will make it difficult or impossible to recognize. You may need to recruit someone with the proper\ldots skills to find the ring without anyone being the wiser.

Amazingly, not all of your current problems have to do with politics and intrigue. In the last few months, you've found yourself missing the \cPirateChild{\child} you gave up 18 years ago. You've sent prayers to Luminary, asking to know if \cPirateChild{\theyare} at least safe. Those prayers have not been answered - you assume that while it is possible to conceal your involvement in many murders over the years  from the mundane authorities, \cFarmGod{} knows and has turned \cFarmGod{\their} back on you. It really is frustrating to have a Deity who cannot see that sometimes the path to the greater good goes through a few bodies.

There's much to accomplish, and little time in which to do it all -- but your brilliant mind can handle it. No one can manipulate a situation to their own ends quite like you can, so you expect to be quite successful indeed. By the end of the weekend you'll hopefully have acquired for yourself a few choice items of power and made your enemies lives a living hell.  You can practically taste the victories.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Assassinate the \pShippies{} Warlord, \cLoud{\full} with help from \cDiplomat{}.
	\item Make sure the treaty negotiations with the L'eau fail, and that the Storm gets sent to the L'eau per your nation's alliance with the Free People's Federation.
	\item Make sure no one finds out you arranged the assassination of the students 6 years ago.
	\item Acquire the \pFarm{} signet ring that \cPrince{} lost, and decide how to best use it to your advantage. 
	\item Steal the enchanted plant that \cCurse{} and \cFlowPriest{} are working on after the enchantment is completed (but before it is planted) so that you can bring it back with you to the \pFarm{}. %(\iBeansMB{\MYnumber}) 
	\item Sniff out and destroy any filthy pirates you find. They've always been a thorn in your side as a leader in the \pFarm{}, and you'll be damned if you let them infest the school. \cPirateChild{} and \cJuniorStatesman{} have particularly drawn your suspicion.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item Due to your dislike of pirates, and frequent clashes with them, you've picked up a little about their code phrases. Pirates often use code phrases that refer to the graveyard where their ships hide as ``untouched waters,'' and tools related to navigation and ``charting courses.'' Anyone using such language is to be viewed with deep suspicion of being a pirate.
	%\item You are almost always one of the Advisors for the Time of Deciding. You begged off 6 years ago, saying you wanted to "give someone else a chance," and then promptly took the position back afterwards, claiming, "clearly they were incompetent, given we lost 4 of the best minds in the CoS under their watch."
	\item International espionage is a thriving trade these days, and given the pivotal events happening this weekend, you would not be at all surprised if spies from all three nations are present. 
	\item The Order of the Black Crocus is, or rather was, a secret international law enforcement entity with jurisdiction across all three nations. As far as you know, it splintered into factions when the war started, each faction subsumed by the intelligence services of its corresponding nation. Good riddance, as far as you're concerned. They were a meddlesome bunch.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} A powerful diplomat from the Free People's Federation, and your co-conspirator on the covert operation that redirected the storm to the \pShip{} 6 years ago. You were the one that covered your tracks. While \cDiplomat{\they} is a useful tool, you trust \cDiplomat{\them} about as far as you can throw \cDiplomat{\them}.
	\contact{\cPrince{}} Your sometimes ally, in addition to being a \cPrince{\Heir} of your country, angling to inherit the throne. 
	\contact{\cInterpol{}} Has a nasty habit of knowing too much of your business, and you're sure there's more to \cInterpol{\them} than meets the eye.
	\contact{\cJuniorStatesman{}} A member of a hated family of \pShippies{}. Pirates, or no better than them.
	\contact{\cHeadScientist{}} A scientist you've conspired with in the past. You've mostly kept your distance, as your interests only intersect sometimes.
	\contact{\cPirateChild{}} A student who has drawn your attention as behaving suspiciously...pirate-like. \cPirateChild{\Their} paperwork looks forged to you, but you have no definitive proof yet, just a feeling\ldots
	\contact{\cCurse{}} A \textbf{commoner} and begrudgingly renowned Curse Maker from Children of the Sun, who is secretly creating a means of accessing the Divine Realm.
	\contact{\cFlowPriest{}} A L'eau \cFlowPriest{\cleric} of Flow and teacher at the College of the Gods, who is secretly creating a means of accessing the Divine Realm.
