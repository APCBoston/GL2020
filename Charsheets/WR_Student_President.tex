\name{\cPresident{}}

You are \cPresident{\full} (\cPresident{\they}/\cPresident{\them}), and a 3rd year student at the \pSchool{}. Now 22 years old, you were elected the Student Body President this year, and as such, it is your (self appointed) job to keep your fellow students safe when the adults won't. As an enrollee from the \pShip{}, you follow the ways of \cEbb{\full} and \cFlow{\full} - but \cEbb{}'s teachings have always spoken to you most deeply. \cEbb{}'s focus on selective pruning of things that are no longer needed in order to provide answers, closure, and a place for the new is wonderful to you.

You were born in the 2nd fleet, and grew up with \cInitiate{\full}, your best friend. The two of you did everything together, including moving to Drova's Landing, a port town in 1st Fleet. That changed a little when it was time to go to school. \cInitiate{\They} went to 1st fleet academy in order to study religion. Meanwhile, you went to the 2nd fleet academy, which focused on politics, negotiation, and economic management, as you hoped to follow in your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}'s footsteps and become a politician. The war breaking out in your 5th year of your schooling increased your fervor for your schoolwork. The only way out of this war was clearly going to be with diplomatic solutions that emphasized justice and reparations for past wrongs. At the \pSchool{}, this education served you well. It has led you to become the student body president, a role that will in turn support your future political career. 

Reunited by the Goddesses' own good fortune with your best friend here at the \pSchool{}, the two of you are more or less unstoppable\ldots{} Or would be if \cInitiate{\their} luck would stop being utterly rotten for 10 seconds. Three months ago, \cInitiate{} received a letter from ``long lost family'' in the \pFarm{}. They demanded \cInitiate{\their} immediate return to \pFarm{}, to take \cInitiate{\their} rightful place in the family. \cInitiate{} had no such inclination to do so initially, but the bad luck curse that came with the letter is really starting to wear \cInitiate{\them} down. The two of you have been trying to find a solution, to no avail, but you're far from giving up. \cInitiate{}'s other friend, \cWarlordDaughter{\full} seems oddly fixated on \cInitiate{} giving \cInitiate{\their} \pFarm{} family a chance. But \cWarlordDaughter{} is not a bad sort, all told, and if \cWarlordDaughter{\their} help breaking the curse could tip the balance, you'd happily welcome it.

Since becoming student body president, you've been thinking more and more about how to protect the students. This mindset has brought with it the intense desire to figure out just what happened at the \pSc{} six years ago - just before the war started - when a unanimous vote sent the storm to the \pShip{} just before the mass murder of every student who voted. How could the students from \pShip{} have ever voted to send the storm there out of turn? They would have known that it disrupted the balance and that it would kill their families and friends. You know there was treachery, there simply must have been. While the Deities presumably saw to the punishment of the direct murderers, it is up to the people to see that justice is brought upon those who enabled it. It is up to you and the one other who is convinced of the urgency of finding these answers— your friend \cHeir{\full}. \cHeir{\Their} older \cHeirSibling{\sibling}, \cHeirSibling{\full}, was one of the student's killed, so it's no surprise \cHeir{} wants to find the truth. Together you have investigated as much as you could, and have made every preparation to be ready to do a ritual of your own devising with ``\iMirror{}'', which is arriving this weekend in the possession of \cDiplomat{\full} (see your Greensheet). Now you just have to hope \cDiplomat{\they} will be willing to let you use it and keep your investigation quiet. If \cDiplomat{\they} \cDiplomat{\are}n't willing\ldots{} will you let it stymie your search for answers? How far are you willing to go to learn the truth? Would you steal from the second most powerful Diplomat of \cDiplomat{\their} generation (behind your \cHeadDiplomat{\Auncle} \cHeadDiplomat{\full}, of course)? This investigation is of the utmost importance. After all, what if whoever did this is still at the \pSc{}? And what if they try to do the same again\dots{}?

Uncovering the past isn't the only thing on your mind. You've also got to look to the future. For the good of your country, the student body in general, and for your friends among them, there are two things happening this weekend that you can't just leave the adults in charge of. For the preservation of the \pSc{}, it is important that the Ley Lines be renewed every three years. As student body president, you feel it is your duty to assist. And then there is the all-important Ritual to Control the Storm. After the voting, a ritual is enacted to channel the magic from the students into actually directing the Storm. The ritual requires the use of one Relic per nation. You anticipate that setting up the ritual will be the most challenging and involved of your tasks this weekend. You are determined to monitor the proceedings and make sure there is no foul play.

Something that may put the Ritual in jeopardy is a problem related to one of the most important figures in the ritual -- the fact that the Librarian, \cLibrarian{\full}, has been acting\ldots{} odd. Almost as if \cLibrarian{\they} \cLibrarian{\does}n't know how to do \cLibrarian{\their} job. Almost as if \cLibrarian{\they} can't \emph{remember} how to do \cLibrarian{\their} job. Normally, publicly accusing someone of murder induced amnesia without proof is a faux-pas. If you're wrong, it will be very embarrassing all around and would tarnish your reputation badly. But if you're right, and \cLibrarian{\theyare} hiding a murder, well, that is a serious crime! \cLibrarian{} is supposed to be the most knowledgeable person at the school about the Ritual, but if \cLibrarian{\they} really \cLibrarian{\have} lost \cLibrarian{\their} memories, particularly for foul reasons, you may find yourself doing a lot of research in a hurry to fill gaps. It's such a shame, too -- you have always had the utmost respect for \cLibrarian{}, and have spent a lot of time with \cLibrarian{\them} in the past, enough to learn the ins and outs of the Library. You always thought \cLibrarian{\they} wouldn't hurt a fly\ldots{}

A few weeks ago, you were studying the protections around the three Relics stored in the library – the ``\iNet{}', the ``\iLariat{}'', and the ``\iScythe{}'' – since the Librarian had been acting so weird and you wanted to make sure everything was as it should be. You don't usually break rules, but in a fit of pride late one night, you snuck down into the deeper levels of the library to see if you could make it to the Relics on your own. Upon succeeding, you realized something terrible – the \iScythe{} was missing - who knows how long it had been gone! Before you could work out how to tell someone (since you shouldn't have been in that area of the library alone), it mysteriously reappeared. Could the \iScythe{}'s disappearance and reappearance be somehow connected to the Librarian acting so weird?

While you try to get along with everybody, \cLibAssist{\full} sometimes tries your patience. \cLibAssist{} is the Librarian's official aid/assistant, and \cLibAssist{\they} can lord it over people sometimes. Comes from being a \pFarm{} noble you suppose. You try not to get on \cLibAssist{\their} bad side though, as \cLibAssist{\they}  can be quite Machiavellian when upset. \cLibAssist{} is not someone to cross lightly. On the other hand, \cLibAssist{} makes a \emph{fantastic} ally and study-partner. Probably the shrewdest mind here among the students this weekend.

In and among all of the responsibilities as Student Body President, time has rather gotten away from you on the social front. You kept meaning to approach \cHeir{}, your fellow 3rd year, or \cChupStudent{\full}, a first year, romantically, but have never quite gotten around to it. You think very highly of both of them and find that you are developing feelings for them. \cHeir{} knows what \cHeir{\they} want\cHeir{\plural} and is willing to fight for it, even if it's going to be hard to achieve. \cHeir{} has a lot of compassion, and you sympathize deeply with \cHeir{\them} for the loss of \cHeir{\their} older \cHeirSibling{\sibling} 6 years ago. \cChupStudent{}, for \cChupStudent{\their} part, is really easygoing (some call \cChupStudent{\them} a slacker), and no one knows how to ``go with the flow'' better. Something about \cChupStudent{\their} laid-back, relaxed manner just puts you at ease, and makes you want to spend long, lazy afternoons together on the beach. Given that you are graduating soon and all the uncertainties this weekend, now might be your last chance to tell one or both of them how you feel. Rushing the job might make things a bit awkward, but \cInitiate{} makes a great wing\cInitiate{\person}. Despite not having any current partners, you identify as polyamorous. Could you possibly be lucky enough that both \cHeir{} and \cChupStudent{} might be interested in you, and willing to try? Even when the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{} do not recognize polyam as a valid relationship structure? And could you really go the rest of your life not knowing what might have been?

The last, but not least, thing on your mind comes in the form of figuring out what happened to your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}, \cHeadDiplomat{}. You were really looking forward to seeing your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle} after a long absence, and getting \cHeadDiplomat{\their} advice on your troubles; the two of you have always been quite close, corresponding frequently, and \cHeadDiplomat{\they} never steered you wrong. But just this morning (mere hours before the advisors arrived), you received news from \cEbbPriest{\full} that \cHeadDiplomat{} won't be coming due to a ``sudden illness.'' The very next letter you opened was from \cJuniorStatesman{\full}, your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}'s skilled and clever apprentice, who told you the truth – your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle} was attacked by an assassin and ended up killing them in self defense. \cHeadDiplomat{} is now a total amnesiac. \cJuniorStatesman{} asked for your help finding whoever sent the assassin -- discreetly, since there is a good chance it is one of the advisors from the other countries, and you don't want to scare them off before you have proof. The public story is still that \cHeadDiplomat{} is suffering from a sudden illness, and \cJuniorStatesman{} asked that you not tell anyone what really happened yet. You are filled with grief over the loss of your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}'s memories, and determined to find those responsible.

This weekend at \pSchool{} will be packed. You and your country both have a lot riding on your actions here. Your top priorities are to ensure that the Rituals goes smoothly, figure out what happened to your \cHeadDiplomat{\Auncle} \cHeadDiplomat{}, and to maybe find love along the way. It will be a lot - but with \cInitiate{} by your side, you know you are up for the challenge.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Ensure the Ritual to Control the Storm and the Ritual to Renew the Ley Lines are set up correctly. Don't let anyone interfere with them.
	\item Find out what happened to the students six years ago with the help of \cHeir{}. Bring anyone responsible who hasn't been punished by the Gods to human justice and make sure they can't do anything like that to you and your classmates.
	\item Make sure the Storm doesn't get sent to the \pShip{} yet again.
	\item Work with \cJuniorStatesman{} to investigate the assassination attempt on your \cHeadDiplomat{\auncle}, \cHeadDiplomat{}.
	\item Figure out if there's any chance of getting together with \cHeir{} and/or \cChupStudent{}.
	\item Help your friend \cInitiate{} get rid of \cInitiate{\their} bad luck curse, and with the decision whether to visit \cInitiate{\their} extended family in the \pFarm{}.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
