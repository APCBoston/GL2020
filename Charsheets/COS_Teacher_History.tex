%% Michael AKA COS Teacher History

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves

%%Spend 2-3 paragraph providing history and giving context/justification for why the character cares about what they care about. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life.  Ie: How did you become a teacher / what do you think about living in the CoS / why are you obsessed about destroying the status quo, what went wrong in your life to cause you not to like it.

%%Spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the character's current life, problems, and priorities. Introduce any contacts from this time in their life. Current life and situation.   What they think about the most important contacts

%%Spend 1-2 paragraph talking about what this character sees for their future. Ground any goals here that haven't been introduced yet.  What are you doing next, what are you trying to accomplish, and why?

%%Spend 1 paragraph to conclude things. Reiterate the character's most important goals (one or two more important, probably one mentioned at the beginning), and most valuable contacts.  Who are they closest to?  Coherent last impression on character

%%No need to include abilities, etc - Tech will include automatically when we go to prod.

History teacher. Wants the ritual to go well
School is largest repository of books, artifacts, etc in all the nations - only spot where storm isn’t supposed to hit as hard so safest place to store artifacts and knowledge
Preservationist?
Essentially rebooted Carmen Sandiego - steals relics from museums and gives them back
Spends time stealing historical artifacts who have them illegally - steal from the rich, give to the museum
Law - priceless artifacts from CoS should be held for all to see in the Queen’s Royal Museum.  
If someone steals a relic, he could steal it back!!!
Needs very distinct mechanic from other information broker and pickpocket in game
Library and smaller / more precious museum at the school (worldly treasures)
Bunkers are also protecting the library and the smaller museum
Gotta protect the relics!  Otherwise why do we even have bunkers?


\textbf{Plots: Primary}

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xCN7BLfzBB3Tt237YSzGKusQj7cmi6nQxATP6aCLgEQ/edit?usp=sharing

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t-0IfPUyv6w-RkDMiytG7EWiUynflrxyMFz4B1tRkG8/edit?usp=sharing
Pro treaty. Feels bad about screwing the WR, and wants people to work together. Michael was privately assigned to be the Queen’s voice unofficially, as she can’t publicly support ending the war.

\textbf{Plots: Secondary}
The Net of Two Phases
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rv5safAChTNCpSK-80O9Q7a3R7tQ5Mwfe89AwtFA0bs/edit?usp=sharing

Researching the war of the gods
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DFStUjq-cH95rfnQNWdMzA0K1vPof8MEQs0QmwRWdH8/edit#
Not explicitly stated in document, presumably helping with research?

Why did the warlord start the war?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/11K_59HPsCmn3bV0UQHoDBrnTp2MyFn6Ax8DJNrtItcU/edit?usp=sharing
Advisors who want treaty to stop the war need to neutralize the warlord somehow.  (Michael is pro treaty) Michael is looking to solve historical records lack of info about the warlord, get the whole story, both for history and queen.

Trading on the black market
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YSPBFxKp7VyLE-c0Emw3tWsl2Ua-Nw-LwUEftAxS8fg/edit#
Eleanor wrote to some L’eau NPC friend/contact that Michael is supposed to be a mostly neutral teacher, but he is secretly besties with the queen and spying/doing her bidding in the school, where her influence is supposed to be limited to the Advisors.  He could lose his job over this, and the L’eau knowing it would be an advantage to them.
