%Rebecca AKA WR Student Initiate

%%Start with a paragraph introducing the character (introduce at highest level): name, country of origin, role (student/teacher/advisor), what they think of religion, and what their #1 top priority should be here at game.  Important first impression of character.  Personality at top also, and how they perceive themselves.

You are \cInitiate{\full} (\cInitiate{\they}/\cInitiate{\them}), and a student at \pSchool{}. You are 22 years old, and an Initiate in the priesthood of \cEbb{} and \cFlow{}. You are from \pShip{}, but your parents ran away from \pFarm{}, and that history has made your life\ldots complicated of late. You thrive on the intersection between magic and engineering, with a distinctly \pShip{} bent. With the help of your best friend, \cPresident{\full}, there is a lot you intend to accomplish before you graduate this weekend.

You were born in the 2nd fleet, and grew up with \cPresident{}, your best friend. The two of you did everything together, except go to academy. You went to 1st fleet academy to study religion with the intent to enter the priesthood. \cPresident{\They} went to 2nd fleet academy, to study politics. Reunited with your best friend here at the \pSchool{} the two of you are more or less unstoppable. 

Except for the bad luck. Three months ago, you received a \iCursedLetter{} from long lost family in the \pFarm{}. They demanded your immediate return to \pFarm{}, to take your rightful place in the family. Something about a curse, and continuing the bloodline\ldots You had no such inclination to do so initially, but the bad luck curse that came with the letter is really wearing you down. You have had no luck dispelling the curse on your own, and not even appeals to the Goddesses has helped. You regularly stay up late talking with \cPresident{} and \cWarlordDaughter{}, another initiate to the priesthood who is here at the school, about what to do. \cWarlordDaughter{} is surprisingly sentimental for someone who is the \cWarlordDaughter{\child} of \cLoud{\full}, the warlord who started and leads the \pShip{} war effort. \cWarlordDaughter{\They} often encourage\cWarlordDaughter{\plural} you to at least give your family in \pFarm{} a chance. \cPresident{} on the other hand is convinced that if you went to your grandparents' place, they would never let you leave.

There's another important decision to make this weekend. You've been putting off picking a path for your priesthood. You will need to pick one Goddess to primarily serve, and with both \cEbbPriest{} and \cFlowPriest{} here this weekend, it's a pretty good opportunity. If you end up deciding to return to your extended family in \pFarm{}, it may be your only opportunity. And it really would be nice to have access to the full range of power that a \cInitiate{\cleric} has.

Before you get too lost in your future though, it's worth engaging with the opportunities of the present. Chief among these  is the chance to study with \cBunker{} when \cBunker{\they} arrive with the \pShip{} delegation to inspect the Bunkers that keep people safe from the Storm at the \pSc{}, while it's power builds this weekend. The wonderful thing about \pShippies{} magic is that it is the craftsmanship. You don't have to give up your love of learning how things work to be a \cInitiate{\cleric}, it makes you stronger.

You also intend to look out for what is best for \pShip{}. You plan to keep an eye on, and take a hand in, setting up the ritual to control the storm. You care for your homeland, and by making sure the ritual is arranged correctly, you can ensure no one is up to anything shady that might screw over the \pShippies{} again.

Aside from your own plans, you are happy to support \cPresident{} in \cPresident{\theirs}. \cPresident{} is looking into what happened to the students six years ago, when the storm was sent out of turn. You suspect that investigation might end up requiring\ldots religious support, but without any way to guess which adults were involved in that mess, you're a much safer option - hopefully the power you have as an initiate will be enough. Your sense of camaraderie with \cPresident{} even goes so far as to wing\cInitiate{\person} for them in matters of love. This being \cPresident{}'s graduation weekend too, \cPresident{\they} \cPresident{\have} left it a little late, but such is the way of things. You think that \cPresident{} could make a good couple with \cHeir{} and/or \cChupStudent{}. You just have to figure out how to get them to open up to each other about their feelings.

Maybe romance is just in the air. You unintentionally learned that the Art teacher, \cChupAvenger{}, is having romantic problems of \cChupAvenger{\their} own. It seems that the love of \cChupAvenger{\their} life, \cHeadScientist{} has forgotten them! Naturally, you are cautious about approaching the situation, since \cChupAvenger{} might not want help from a student, and it all begs the question of what \cHeadScientist{} did to lose part of \cHeadScientist{\their} memories. But on the other hand, how cool would it be to help these two get back together?

So this weekend is going to be busy. You have a lot of decisions to make about your own future, the future of your nation to protect, and the future of your friends to help build. Which Goddess will you choose to serve? Will \cPresident{} or \cChupAvenger{} find romance with your help? and will you break the bad luck curse, or acquiesce to your \pFarm{} family's demands?

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Pick whether you will follow the path of \cEbb{\full}, \cFlow{\full} or attempt the near impossible of the Path of Balance.
	\item Help resurrect the \cEbb{} avatar. Without it, you could not pick to follow \cEbb{}'s path.
	\item Deal with the bad luck curse. Find a way to break it (knowing who cast it would help), or decide you are going to return to your extended family in \pFarm{}.
	\item Help \cPresident{} out with \cPresident{\their} investigations, and if you can get \cPresident{\them} to put work aside for a minute, help \cPresident{\them} approach \cHeir{} and/or \cChupStudent{} as potential romantic partners.
	\item Help \cChupAvenger{} out with getting \cHeadScientist{} to regain \cHeadScientist{\their} memories of \cChupAvenger{}.
	\item Hang out with \cBunker{}, and learn as much as you can about engineering from \cBunker{\them}.
\end{itemz}
