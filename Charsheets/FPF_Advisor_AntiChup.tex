\name{\cAntiChup{}}

You are \cAntiChup{\full} (\cAntiChup{\they}/\cAntiChup{\them}), citizen of the \pTech{} and in the prime of your career at 63.  As the High Priest, you are the true power behind the Temple of \cTechGod{}, overseeing the faith and the faithful of your nation, as well as the \pTech{} spy network. While your friend and colleague \cCouncilPriest{} holds the higher formal title of \cTechGod{}'s Grace and deals with the bureaucracy of the Council position, you are empowered to use your own less conspicuous power to keep the beating heart of the Temple under your finely gloved thumb. 

Born to a wealthy and religious family, you knew you wanted to become a priest from a young age, and your dream was soon realized. As a young priest, your somber duty at the temple was approving or rejecting new inventions. Many ideas were too grandiose to be practical – impossible to mass produce or so revolutionary that they could shake the foundations of your carefully curated utopia to which change must be introduced gradually. The inventors seldom understood your rulings, trapped in their tunnel vision and unable to see the big picture. On one memorable occasion twelve years ago, you were physically attacked over rejecting a magically powered icebox for which it would have taken decades to create the manufacturing capability to produce at scale. Honestly, unless an inventor has the money and connections to understand what the manufacturing capabilities of the Free People's Federation are, most of what they create are foolish pipe dreams. As you rose through the ranks of the priesthood, you became increasingly involved in the temple's spy network, seeing it as another essential tool in maintaining social stability. After serving with distinction for decades, you at last rose to the position of High Priest, free to shape temple policy to best serve the will of \cTechGod{}. The only worldly authority you answer to now is your colleague \cCouncilPriest{} and \cCouncilPriest{\their} fellow Council members.

This weekend you'll have the honor of attending \pSchool{} as an Advisor, and while you've held this role occasionally before when your \textbf{many} other duties allow, this time feels especially momentous as a personal success. Your own protégé, \cScholarship{\full}, is attending as one of the students honored with the sacred privilege of voting to direct the Deities' mighty Storm. It is through your decades of hard work and cutthroat determination that you now find yourself at this most auspicious event, not only as the voice of \cTechGod{} \cTechGod{\them}self, but also in such a position to raise up this most promising young devotee in your own image, empowering \cScholarship{\them} to continue your work and further your power both nationally and abroad. Ever since \cScholarship{} began attending the \pSchool{}, you've been obligated to send \cScholarship{\them} only on missions that \cScholarship{\they} could complete on  \cScholarship{\their} own. Now that you are here in person, you can collaborate directly and provide in-person guidance in ways not usually available to you. You'll do \emph{whatever} it takes to ensure that this weekend is a success, and you couldn't be more thrilled at the prospect of such victories. 

Your relationship with \cScholarship{} is somewhat complicated however. \cScholarship{} attends the school by the grace of a Temple scholarship you arranged personally, and so will of course do your bidding. Originally, this was all there was to your relationship, but you uncharacteristically began to develop a certain fondness for your young pupil. \cScholarship{\theyare} bright, clever, ambitious, and you truly believe \cScholarship{\they} will go far in life. Unfortunately, you only realized this recently, after the latest undertaking you forced \cScholarship{\them} through that you're sure \cScholarship{\they} found unpleasant. You had sent \cScholarship{} on a dangerous mission to ``borrow'' the \iScythe{} from the \pSc{} library and use it to assassinate the Avatar of \cEbbFull{\full}. The mission was a resounding success, giving the \pTech{} the upper hand in the war by eliminating the connection between the \pShip{} and one of their twin Goddesses; the fact that it removed the attunement of the \iScythe{} from the \pFarm{} nation was a small price to pay. Relics can always be reattuned, but the opportunity to deal a crippling blow to one's enemies only comes along so often. 

But there was a greater price to you personally, which didn't become apparent until later. After the mission, you intercepted one of \cScholarship{}'s outgoing letters, and therein learned that \cScholarship{\they} want\cScholarship{\plural} to leave your tutelage. You expected to feel nothing but vague annoyance at another tool breaking -- but from the degree of hurt you felt, you realized that you had developed quite a distressing degree of \cAntiChup{\parent}ly feelings toward \cScholarship{\them}. You have allowed yourself to indulge in these thoughts to some extent -- enough to acknowledge that ultimately you do want to see \cScholarship{} happy. It is next to impossible for you to conceive of how \cScholarship{\they} could be happy with a different mentor -- no one can smooth \cScholarship{\their} way to the upper echelons of the church like you. No one could give \cScholarship{\them} half the power that you could. Perhaps \cScholarship{\they} just need\cScholarship{\plural} a serious talking to, to come to \cScholarship{\their} senses? But starting such a conversation would be challenging, as you are loath to admit that you've been going through \cScholarship{\their} mail. If ultimately \cScholarship{} chooses the suboptimal path, and insists on leaving you, all is not lost. \cScholarship{\Their} new sponsor will need to convince you that \emph{they} are worthy of \cScholarship{} before you will agree to sign away \cScholarship{}'s scholarship documentation.

Regardless of how that resolves, there is work for you and \cScholarship{} to do in the mean time. The first order of business is the all important matter of the vote to direct the Storm. The hardest part will be ensuring that it is \cScholarship{} who gains the highest rank in voting authority. Your protégé is a strong candidate, but the \cHeir{\child} of the mighty Faledon family, \cHeir{\full}, is a strong competitor. Thanks to the Faledon family's staunch ally \cDiplomat{\full} attending this weekend, it's unlikely you'll be the one dictating how \cHeir{} votes. Your best bet, therefore, is to find a way to weaken \cHeir{\their} position with the \pShip{} teachers and rest of the \pTech{} advisors -- who will be ranking the \pTech{} students for voting authority -- and put your own carefully cultivated pawn into play in \cHeir{}'s place. It is, after all, crucial that the Storm be sent once again to the \pShip{} so that the treaty protecting your nation from the Storm, and starvation, is upheld. It is your sacred duty to protect your people, and \cTechGod{}'s will that you should succeed by any means necessary. And while you're pulling the strings in your own nation, it would also be of great benefit if you could similarly find ways to ensure that the students from \pFarm{} also uphold their nation's end of the shared treaty.

There is another task for you and \cScholarship{} this weekend. Everyone knows that \cInitiate{\full} and \cWarlordDaughter{\full} are initiates to the \pShip{} religious structure, but information from your spy network suggests that \cPirate{\full}, one of the teachers, may also be trying to become a \cPirate{\cleric}. Such a thing is unheard of in someone \cPirate{\their} age, but it does present an opportunity. While messing with \cWarlordDaughter{} might upset too much of the delicate balance that is war, \cInitiate{} and \cPirate{} are both ideal candidates to become your eyes and ears in \pShip{}, whether they know it or not. And so you have devised a plan to acquire influence over both of them. For one, you will use a bespoke Curse to make them into a scrying conduit, allowing you to see and hear through them undetected (see greensheet ``Creating an Unsuspecting Birdie''). The other one you will have to manage by more conventional means such as blackmail. In order to obtain the Curse, you have contracted the help of the \pSc{}'s curse breaking teacher -- \cPrince{\full}, to whom you promised support in a bid for the throne. You expect \cScholarship{} will come in handy for the parts of the plan requiring stealth. And stealth will most assuredly be required – you've received intelligence that the \pShip{} have a spy here this weekend among their advisors. You'd best find out who it is, and make sure they don't uncover your plot or do anything else to interfere with the will of \cTechGod{}! You would not be surprised if the \pFarm{} have a spy here as well, given the important events happening this weekend, but that is just a hunch.

Speaking of the will of \cTechGod{}, as a \cAntiChup{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}, you have additional duties to perform -- things like spiritual guidance and leading rituals. This task is made more challenging by your counterpart, \cBeetle{\full}. \cBeetle{} is \emph{technically} a \cBeetle{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}, but has clearly gone soft. \cBeetle{\Theyare} slow to act, and slow to pass information back to the church and \cBeetle{\their} home country, to which \cBeetle{\they} owe\cBeetle{\plural} allegiance. You do not expect to be able to rely on \cBeetle{} for all but the most trivial duties.

This leaves the most important role of a \cAntiChup{\cleric} of \cTechGod{} to you: striking against any and all blasphemy against \cTechGod{}. Being your nation's spymaster helps with this endeavor. The worst form of blasphemy is that which is perpetrated by the \pGoaties{} -- an infamous cult that has been insidiously growing in the shadows over the last decade. These heretics would upset the natural balance by elevating their deity Genesis, one of many insignificant minor gods, to the status of a fifth patron Deity on par with the Gods of the three nations. Their blasphemies do not end there, and include circumventing proper channels of authority, ignoring Intellectual Property rights, scam artistry, and the unregulated magical activation of technology -- undermining the pillars of civilization on which the \pTech{} was built. The \pGoaties{} are the power behind the notorious Black Market, an international scourge and the deepest sign of their rejection of \cTechGod{}. More times than you care to count, you've read reports of your own people being cursed or maimed on the battlefield by weapons developed by their countrymen, stolen from the \pTech{} and sold illegally to your nation's enemies. You plan to use the opportunities afforded you this weekend to hunt down and capture the leadership of the \pGoaties{}, and thus remove their unholy influence from your meticulously crafted world. 

You have pieced together from various spy reports that the highest ranking members of the \pGoaties{}, including their ever elusive leader, are going to be present at the \pSchool{} this very weekend. You've also received intelligence that one of the \pTech{} teachers at the college is involved in the Black Market. In other words, one of: \cEthics{\full}, \cBeetle{\full}, \cLibrarian{\full}, and \cChupInventor{\full}. Could this be why \cBeetle{} is so useless as a \cBeetle{\cleric}? That can't be a coincidence. The cult no doubt has some evil planned and it is paramount that you not only stop them, but catch them red-handed. The salvation of your nation is, as always, the precious and sacred burden granted you by \cTechGod{}. The symbol of the \pGoaties{} is a four-leaf clover; anyone bearing it is a suspect. When you the find members of the \pGoaties{}, it would be best to capture them and bring them back to the \pTech{} for interrogation. Dead people don't talk, and leads released into the custody of other nations have a distressing tendency to escape before you get your turn.

Lastly, as an advisor, you are technically supposed to be involved in the treaty negotiations taking place this weekend between the three nations. Honestly, you are so busy with more important things that the distasteful business of treating with the enemy is not a priority for you. \cDiplomat{} can probably handle it without you, though you must admit that staying informed on international dealings is useful. For the time being, you've delegated the mundane task of monitoring the proceedings to \cScholarship{}, with instructions to come get you if anything important happens. But it is possible that you have piled a little too much on \cScholarship{their} plate, and will need to become more actively involved.

This weekend will be a whirlwind. You expect to be kept quite busy by your investigations, negotiations, and wrangling your wayward protégé. But just like in all things before now, you will not fail. You are backed by not only \cTechGod{}, highest of Gods -- but also the collective will of the entire \pTech{}.

\begin{itemz}[Goals (in roughly descending order of importance)]
	\item Find the \pGoaties{}, stop whatever they currently have planned, accumulate evidence of their myriad past crimes, and bring them to justice for it all. Shut down their unholy Black Market.
	\item Ensure that \cScholarship{} gets the highest number of votes to control the Storm among the \pTech{} students. By any means necessary, ensure that the Storm be sent to the \pShip{}, to preserve the treaty between the \pFarm{} and the \pTech{}.
	\item Work with \cScholarship{} and \cPrince{} to complete and deploy the Curse that will turn one of your two \pShip{} targets, \cInitiate{} or \cPirate{}, into your unwitting spy. Find blackmail on the other to force them to become your informant. Make sure that your efforts are not discovered and foiled by the \pShip{} spy here this weekend, and unmask them if you can.
	\item Convince \cScholarship{} that \cScholarship{\their} best chance of a successful life and career, and therefore happiness, is by remaining under your tutelage. If \cScholarship{\they} will not see reason, at least vet their potential new mentor with great care to make sure they are worthy.
	\item Keep an eye on the preparations for the Ritual to Control the Storm, and assist as necessary given your role as \cAntiChup{\cleric} of \cTechGod{}. 
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item The last time you were present at the school for the Time of Deciding was 9 years ago.
	\item International espionage is a thriving trade these days, and given the pivotal events happening this weekend, you would not be at all surprised if spies from all three nations are present. 
	\item The Order of the Black Crocus is, or rather was, a secret international law enforcement entity with jurisdiction across all three nations. As far as you know, it splintered into factions when the war started, each faction subsumed by the intelligence services of its corresponding nation. You certainly did that with the \pTech{} branch. You have mixed feelings about the group. On the one hand, they were constantly meddling in your affairs as Spymaster, but on the other, they did much to curtail the Black Market.
	\item Any magitech device, regardless of who made it, but \emph{especially} if it is made by \pTech{} citizens, must be empowered by a Clerics of \cTechGod{} according to Church doctrine. Any device that is activated by another means, such as whatever sacrilegious means the black market has, is both illegal and blasphemous. Inventors can temporarily activate a prototype (for approx. 30 min.) for the sole purpose of demonstrating it's functionality, but only properly trained Clerics should be able to permanently activate it, and then, only with written approval from the Church.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cScholarship{}} Your protégé, who you think of almost as your \cScholarship{\child}. \cScholarship{\They} \cScholarship{\are} one of your most valuable tools to accomplish your goals this weekend.
            \contact{\cPrince{}} A collaborator in your bid to corrupt the rising \pShip{} clerics. You promised support for the throne in exchange for \cPrince{\their} help with curses.
	\contact{\cBeetle{}} The other \pTech{} \cBeetle{\cleric} here. \cBeetle{\They} seem\cBeetle{\plural} to be ignoring \cBeetle{\their} responsibilities toward the \pTech{}. Hopefully it's no more than complacency borne of being too long away from the \pTech{} and working daily with \cTechGod{}'s people.
	\contact{\cDiplomat{}} Your advisor counterpart at the negotiating table. Where you represent the Temple, \cDiplomat{\they} represent\cDiplomat{\plural} the government. \cDiplomat{} is a moderately competent diplomat, having forged the original treaty 6 years ago. Still, \cDiplomat{\they} favor \cHeir{} to be the student with the highest voting authority, and you simply cannot allow that.
	\contact{\cPirate{}} The Shop and Crafting teacher at the school, and, rumor has it, interested in becoming a \cPirate{\cleric} of Ebb or Flow. One of your potential targets for becoming your unwitting magical informant through the curse you are crafting with \cPrince{}.
	\contact{\cInitiate{}} A student at the school training to become a \cInitiate{\cleric} of Ebb or Flow. One of your potential targets for becoming your unwitting magical informant through the curse you are crafting with \cPrince{}.
