For those who become a Cleric of \cFarmGod{}, the path is full of beauty, wonder, and possibility.  It is an opportunity for those amongst the working class to pursue a life of music, scholarship, or education; and it is an opportunity for the non or less magically gifted children among the Nobility to find purpose in life outside of childcare and estate management.  For details about \cFarmGod{}'s precepts and domains, see the \pFarm{} bluesheet.

\section{A Cleric's Powers and Responsibilities}
Clerics are expected to be sources of advice and support to their community.  They lead rituals to honor \cFarmGod{}.  They guide wayward souls back to the path of goodness.  They enforce the rules of society, through parables and advice.  The clerics form the backbone of the \pFarm{} education system for the commoners.  They work in tandem with the younger children of noble families who choose to go into education.  

\cFarmGod{} grants \cFarmGod{\their} Clerics power in the finely honed musical healing arts.  \pFarm{} Clerics with only rudimentary musical talents find that the songs of healing bloom in their hearts and spill easily from their lips after they dedicate themselves to \cFarmGod{} and accept \cFarmGod{\their} touch.  Those Clerics strongest in the healing arts find that over time they develop almost a prescience when it comes to the health of the community.  They will feel called to walk a certain path, only to come upon someone ill or injured on their travel.

For those for whom teaching does not suit, there is the opportunity to become a historian or a researcher.  The Church of \cFarmGod{} keeps many of the records of the \pFarm{}.  If one can earn a spot at one of the research institutions, one can study and research the most esoteric of religious doctrine.  That said, there is little tolerance for dissenting voices in the faith, and the Church has a sordid history of religious suppression.  200 years ago, a splinter faction known as the Aethers challenged well established Church canon that the Divine Realm had been severed from the mortal realm by the will of the Gods.  These heretics puportedly developed a ritual to travel between the two worlds, and remain corporeal in the Divine Realm.  For this blasphemy, the entire group was killed off in a bloody purge by the mainstream Church.  To this day, anyone who speaks of traveling to the Divine Realm, or otherwise challenging Church doctrine, is seen as a heretic to be stopped and silenced.

\section*{The Hummingbirds}
Fewer and fewer of the Avatars of \cFarmGod{}, the giant hummingbirds, have been seen in the past decade.  Some scholars point to times in history when this has happened, and posit that it is a natural cycle.  Others fret that it might be an ill omen of some kind.  So far, the Priesthood has done its best to keep a lid on the fact that the Hummingbirds are disappearing, but the rumors grow more difficult to contain with each passing year.
